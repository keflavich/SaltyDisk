\title{Orion \sourcei's disk is salty}
\begin{abstract}
    We report the detection of NaCl and KCl and the $^{37}$Cl and $^{41}$K
    isotopologues toward the disk around Orion \sourcei.
    This is the first detection of these molecules in the interstellar
    medium not associated with the ejecta of evolved stars.
    These lines are likely to be unique tracers of a rare process, either
    the birth of high-mass stars or the aftermath of a stellar collision.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Molecules consisting of alkali metals and halogens have been detected
toward evolved stars including IRC +10216 \citep{Cernicharo1987a},
{\color{red}Discussion of AGB*s is now in the discussion session.}

The lines of NaCl and KCl have been catalogued by \citet{Caris2004a}
and more comprehensively and thoroughly by \citet{Barton2014a}.
The latter includes over 10$^5$ transitions for each species
with levels up to $E_U\sim5\ee{4}$ K.  Prior to this work,
no astronomical detections of vibrationally excited transitions
of any of these species have been reported \citep[e.g., see the review
by][]{McGuire2018}

In \citet[][the brine paper]{Ginsburg2018b}, we used lines of
\water and one or more unknown species to measure the rotation curve of
the disk around \sourcei.  We have now identified these unknown lines as
transitions of NaCl and KCl.

\section{Observations}
The observations presented here are described in \citet{Ginsburg2018b} as part
of ALMA project 2016.1.00165.S.  We use the robust 0.5 weighted spectral cubes
from all three bands (B3 3 mm, B6 1 mm, B7 0.85 mm) for the spectral analysis
presented here.

Appendix D of that paper describes the spectral extraction method,
which we summarize here.  We used the U232.511 line (which we identify here as
NaCl v=1 J=18-17) to create a velocity centroid map.  For each spectrum with
a measured velocity, we shifted the spectrum to 0 \kms, then averaged those
spectra.  The averaging area is approximately the extent of the continuum
disk, 0.03 square arcseconds, or about 20 beam areas at band 6, resulting
in an improvement in the signal-to-noise of about $4\times$.


\section{Results}
We have clearly identified the carrier of the majority [what number?]
of unidentified lines in the \citet{Ginsburg2018b} spectra.
The lines have amplitudes in the range 0.5-3 mJy \perbeam, corresponding
to brightness temperatures 5-20 K.

In the appendix of \citet{Ginsburg2018b}, we reported that ``there is no
consistent pattern to the detected lines and no individual species can explain
more than a few of the observed lines.''  This statement was incorrect, as
there are obvious carriers for the majority of the unidentified lines that we
had simply overlooked: NaCl, KCl, and their isotopologues.

Figures 1-3 shows the spectra with lines labeled.  We have labeled all of the
detections and marginal detections of salt lines.  We also labeled the most
prominent outflow (e.g., SiO and H$_2$O) lines.
%We additionally labeled
%\emph{some} of the lines that were not detected because of severe confusion

In Tables \ref{tab:all_detections_B3}-\ref{tab:all_detections_B7}, we report
all of the lines that are in our observable band and whether or not they were
detected.  We employ the following
flag scheme:
`d' for detection `n' for nondetection, `q' for questionable (e.g., low
signal-to-noise, but possibly detected, or in regions where the noise is
not Gaussian and may be affected by other lines).
We additionally include a flag `c' for `confused', which we add to the flag
string if the line is blended with another brighter line of a different species.

\textbf{\color{red} At the moment, all of the line frequencies are shifted
to higher frequencies by 17 \kms (KCl) and 3 \kms (NaCl) because of a discrepancy
between the \citep{Barton2014a} catalog line frequencies and those of CDMS,
JPL, and SLAIM.  The latter three, catalogued in Splatalogue, agree, and they
agree better with my measurements.}

The low observed brightness temperatures suggest that the emission from
these lines is optically thin.




\section{Discussion}
The lines we have reported have only been seen in a small handful of other sources,
all of which were moderately high-mass evolved stars blowing off their envelopes.
The known detections include the carbon star envelope IRC +10216 \citep{Cernicharo1987a},
the post-AGB star envelope CRL 2688 \citep{Highberger2003a}, and the oxygen-rich
evolved star envelopes of VY Canis Majoris and IK Tauri \citep{Milam2007a}.
\sourcei is only the 5th astronomical source in which KCl and NaCl have been
detected.
However, there were no detections of vibrationally excited NaCl or KCl in any
of the previous observations \citep[][presented the most systematic study of salt
lines, which only included detections of v=0 rotational transitions]{Agundez2012a},
while \sourcei has clear detections at least up to v=6, likely up to v=8, in both
NaCl and KCl.

In these evolved stars, v=0 rotational transitions of NaCl were observed
with rotational temperatures $T_{rot}\sim70-100$ K (IK Tau, VY CMa), inferred
local temperatures of $\sim200$ K in shocks (CRL 2688), .
% Carbon star envelope IRC +10216, d ~ 170 pc
% CRL2688 post-AGB * \citep{Highberger2003a} ~ 1 kpc

These lines trace a rare physical phenomenon.  They are therefore an excellent tracer
of this phenomenon, assuming they are detected

Sodium and potassium are rarely observed in the dense molecular interstellar medium.
They are usually assumed to be rapidly incorporated into dust grains [cite?  Milam
says this, but there's a better original source.  Lodders \& Fegley 1999?].  Since we clearly observe NaCl
and KCl in the atmosphere of the disk, it is clear that there is a zone where either
dust has not yet formed or where dust is destroyed and returned to the gas phase.
{\color{red} What can we say about the dust destruction/sublimation zone?  I need
to do some disk research; there must be a dust sublimation zone at the surfaces
of disks in addition to the radial one.}

\subsection{Excitation}
We detect highly excited transitions of NaCl and KCl, many with Einstein A coefficients
in the range $\sim0.01-0.1$ s$^{-1}$.  These high excitation lines are unlikely
to be excited by collisions, since the gas would have to be hot enough to excite
molecules into states with $E_U > 2000$ K and would therefore likely be hot enough
to dissociate the molecules {\color{red} It would be nice to back this up with numbers}.  Alternately,
at high densities and more moderate temperatures, the salts would likely be absorbed
into dust grains.

We calculate the level population as
\begin{equation}
    N_u = \frac{8 \pi \nu k_B}{g_u c^2 h A_{ul}} \int T_A d\nu
%    nline = 8 * np.pi * freq * constants.k_B / constants.h / Aul / constants.c**2
%    # term2 = np.exp(-constants.h*freq/(constants.k_B*Tex)) -1
%    # term2 -> kt / hnu
%    # kelvin-hertz
%    Khz = (kkms * (freq/constants.c)).to(u.K * u.MHz)
%    return (nline * Khz / degeneracies).to(u.cm**-2)
\end{equation}
{\color{red} (this is mostly a sanity check)}

Within each vibrational state for which we have several transitions, we can
measure a rotational temperature.  For the KCl v=0 state, in which we have
detected 4 rotational transitions from $30 < E_U < 400$ K, the best fit
rotational temperature is $T_{rot}\sim105$ K (Figure
\ref{fig:rotationdiagrams}).  At such a low temperature, the populations of the
vibrationally excited states should be effectively zero.  These observations
combined suggest that there is a radiative mechanism exciting the vibrational
states.


% Since the highest clearly detected energy state detected has $E_U\sim3000$ K
% (see Table \ref{tab:all_detections_B3}; the v=6 lines of NaCl have three
% J-transitions detected), the radiation field likely turns over at around this
% temperature, implying the presence of a slightly cooler radiation field than
% implied in \citet{Testi2010a}, but still much warmer than the equilibrium temperature
% of the disk at this radius.  
% However, it is also possible that the higher-excitation lines are simply too faint
% to be detected at our $\sim0.4$ mJy/\kms RMS limit.

{\color{red} This is a note to be incorporated somewhere:}
The $\delta v=1$ rovibrational transitions of KCl are all around 36.1-38 \um,
while the NaCl transitions are in the range 27.6-30 \um.
More interesting for constraining the exciting source, though, are the v=0 to
v=1 through v=8 lines.
For example, the KCl v=6-0 J=1-0 line is at 6.13 \um and the NaCl v=7-0 J=1-0
line is at 4.07 \um.  Assuming the population of these lines are created
from excitation from the ground state, they require a blackbody radiation field
of $T\approx500-750$ K ($T\approx b / \lambda$, where $b\approx2900$ \um K is
Wien's displacement constant).


A plausible scenario is that the hot radiation field from the central star,
with $T_*\sim4000$ K \citep{Testi2010a}, excites molecules to high vibrational
excitation states, from which they cascade through rovibrational transitions
down to the v=0 state, providing a relatively uniform level population
from $E_U=0$ to $E_U\approx T_*$ instead of a thermal level population.
However, a 4000 K blackbody should produce most of its flux around 1 \um,
which should result in much higher excitation than we observe.  Either
the higher-excitation lines are too faint {\color{red} do we expect this?}
or the salt emission is coming from a region of the disk that is shielded
behind an extinction layer.   Since the salts would likely be incorporated into
grains {\color{red}can we back this?} if a large population of grains
were present, it is not clear that such a layer can exist.


\subsection{Future prospects}
The detection of these refractory species in the gas phase in the atmosphere
of \sourcei's disk hints that other refractory molecules may be present, 
enabling their first detection in the ISM (e.g., such rare species as FeO and FeS),
and may enable direct measurments of the metallicity in star-forming gas.
It remains unclear whether \sourcei is a unique source or is representative
of the class of high-mass protostars with disks; if the latter, these lines
and potentially many others can be used to probe the radiation environment of 
extremely embedded high-mass protostars.

% We plot and fit rotational diagrams to measure the abundance and temperature of
% these molecules.  However, the results are ambiguous: for each vibrational
% state with more than one detected transition, we are able to fit an excitation
% temperature, but the abundances of the vibrationally excited states are much
% higher than the ground state.  This distribution implies that the lines are
% radiatively excited.
%
% The excitation temperatures derived from the rotational diagram fits are in the
% range 50-100 K.  The
% radiation temperature within 50 AU of a $10^4$ \lsun star should be $T_R>500$ K,
% so how do we get lower temperatures?
% {\color{red} This is a place for some discussion: is it possible that the gas
% is cooler and the transitions we're seeing are affected by collisions?
% This is the process invoked in \citet{Kaplan2017a}, but it doesn't make sense here:
% it requires the gas to be below the radiation temperature.  Also, the critical density
% of these transitions is likely to be absurdly high, given their A-values in the 0.1s
% range.}
