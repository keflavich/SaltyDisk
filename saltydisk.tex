\title{Orion \sourcei's disk is salty}
% and I am too.

\begin{abstract}
    We report the detection of NaCl and KCl and their $^{37}$Cl and $^{41}$K
    isotopologues toward the disk around Orion \sourcei.  About 60 transitions
    of these molecules were identified.
    This is the first detection of these molecules in the interstellar
    medium not associated with the ejecta of evolved stars.  It is also
    the first ever detection of the vibrationally excited states of these
    lines in the ISM above $v=1$, with firm detections up to $v=6$.
    The salt emission traces the region just above the continuum disk,
    possibly forming the base of the outflow.  The emission from the
    vibrationally excited transitions is inconsistent with a single
    temperature, implying the lines are not in LTE.  We examine several
    possible explanations of the observed high excitation lines, concluding
    that the vibrational states are most likely to be radiatively excited via
    rovibrational transitions in the 25-35 \um (NaCl) and 35-45 \um (KCl)
    range.  We suggest that the molecules are produced by destruction of dust
    particles.  Because these molecules are so rare, they are potentially
    unique tools for identifying high-mass protostellar disks and measuring the
    radiation environment around accreting young stars.

\section{Introduction}
The disk around Orion Source I (\sourcei) has been the subject of intense
study, as it is the closest \citep[$d\approx400$ pc;][]{Grossschedl2018a} disk
around a `high-mass' ($M>8$ \msun) star
\citep{Hirota2014a,Plambeck2016a,Ginsburg2018b}.  It is also in many ways
a unique source, being the only known protostellar object with \referee{both}
SiO and \water
masers in an outflow
\citep{Plambeck2009a,Goddi2009a,Matthews2010a,Goddi2010a,Niederhofer2012a,Greenhill2013a}.
In \citet{Ginsburg2018b}, a subset of the authors reported 0.03$\arcsec$ ALMA
observations of \sourcei that allowed
a measurement of the outer rotation curve of
the 5(5,0)-6(4,3) \water line in the disk and along the base of the outflow;
these measurements showed that the interior mass was $15 \pm 2$ \msun.  In the
same data, we found additional emission lines that closely traced the disk and
its Keplerian rotation curve, but were unable to identify the molecular species
responsible for these lines.  We now identify them as transitions of NaCl and
KCl and their isotopologues, many in excited vibrational levels.

% \rlp{I commented out this paragraph because some of it repeats what is
% in the first paragraph, and the rest can be covered in the discussion.}
% The environments around forming stars, however, are also known to harbor
% molecules that are often rapidly depleted from the gas-phase after ejection.
% Disks around forming high-mass stars have been resolved only a handful of
% times.  The disk around Orion Source I (\sourcei) has frequently been observed
% \citep{Hirota2014a,Plambeck2016a,Ginsburg2018b}, but most molecular species
% detected trace either an outflow (e.g., SiO) or some combination of the outflow
% and the disk (e.g., \water).  In HH80/81, a $\sim4$ \msun disk around a
% $\sim10-20$ \msun star, several lines of SO$_2$ are associated with the disk
% \citep{Girart2017a}.  Beyond these two sources, only disordered structures or
% disk-envelope blends have been observed.

% While the disk around Source I has been seen in several lines and confirmed
% to have a Keplerian rotation curve, such disks are rarely observed around massive
% stars.  Toward most accreting high-mass stars, the spectrum is dominated by
% the surrounding hot core \citep{Cesaroni2017a,Goddi2018a}.  By contrast, the
% disks around low-mass stars are often easily distinguished from their surroundings,
% either because they retain a disk after blowing away the parent core, or because
% the core is cooler and fewer lines are excited.  The identification of lines that
% trace disks around high-mass stars is therefore an important goal.


Disks are ubiquitous around forming stars of any mass.  They provide the main
mechanism for mediating accretion, and, via outflows, shedding angular momentum
from the system.  Despite their theoretical importance, the role of disks in
high-mass star formation remains observationally uncertain, since the only
definitive disk detections are around stars that have already acquired most of
their mass \citep[e.g.,][]{Girart2017a}.  The lack of clear disk detections
is, at least in part, because there were no known spectral lines that trace a
disk and not the molecule-rich ``hot core'' in the surrounding region
\cite{Goddi2018a,Cesaroni2017a}.  For low-mass sources, where the disks are
observed in isolation after the surrounding core has accreted or dispersed,
this ambiguity is absent.  For high-mass sources, which evolve so quickly that
the disks are still embedded in their natal hot core, substantial confusion can
arise.  Further complicating matters, the large amount of dust in these dense
regions may obscure the disks at wavelengths shorter than 3 mm.

While dozens of species have been detected in the disks around low-mass stars
\citep{McGuire2018c}, these molecules are comprised solely of a small selection
of elements: H, C, N, O, and S.  All of the molecules seen in disks are also
prevalent in the ISM, particularly in the hot cores surrounding high-mass stars
\citep{Nummelin1998a,Belloche2013a}. In high-mass environments, this therefore
limits their utility as unique disk tracers, hiding the kinematic signatures of
rotation.


% At the other extreme of the stellar life cycle, in the atmospheres of dying
% stars, a wealth of exotic molecules -- those containing rare elements not
% commonly seen in star-forming regions -- are observed.  Stars along the
% asymptotic giant branch (AGB) lose substantial mass in slow winds
% \citep{Herwig2005a} that form molecules with high atomic weight elements that
% rapidly condense onto dust particles.  The most notable example is that of
% IRC+10216, the expanding gas cloud around the AGB star CW Leonis.  Here, NaCl,
% KCl, AlCl, AlF, NaCN, and a number of other metal-bearing (in the chemists'
% sense) molecules have been detected \citep{Agundez2012a,Zack2011a}.  NaCl and
% KCl have been detected around a small handful of other AGB and post-AGB stars
% \citep{Milam2007a,Highberger2003a,Sanchez-Contreras2018a}, but to our knowledge,
% no detections outside of these environments have previously been reported.

Molecules consisting of alkali metals and halogens have only rarely
been detected in space \citep{McGuire2018c}.  Because of their rarity, their
use as a diagnostic tool to measure metallicity and local physical conditions
has been limited.  However, some of these molecules, such as KCl and NaCl, have
a rich spectrum with dozens of lines arising in a single observing band
% with modern instrumentation, 
so they have great potential to probe either local gas
properties or the radiation field when they are detected.


KCl and NaCl have so far been observed toward evolved stars including the
carbon star IRC +10216 \citep{Cernicharo1987a}, the oxygen-rich evolved stars IK
Tauri and VY Canis
Majoris \citep{Milam2007a}, the post-AGB star envelope CRL 2688
\citep{Highberger2003a}, and the AGB star wind around OH 231+4.2
\citep{Sanchez-Contreras2018a}.  In these sources, they exist only in a limited
range of radii from the central star as they are
carried outward
in slow winds \citep{Herwig2005a}.  The limited environments in which these
molecules have been detected suggests that they persist in the gas phase
for only a brief period 
before they are incorporated into dust grains.
This transient gas-phase abundance is analogous to that which makes SiO an
excellent tracer of recent shock events: Si is sputtered from grains into the
gas phase where it reacts with oxygen to form SiO.  Further reactions rapidly
form SiO$_2$, depleting the gas-phase SiO abundance, and making that molecule
an indicator of a recent shock \citep{Schilke1997a}. 

If the production pathways, and role of the physical environment on those
pathways, can be constrained for NaCl and KCl, the presence of these molecules
has the potential to be a powerful tracer of gas physical conditions and
history.  The rarity of these molecules in the ISM makes them a uniquely
powerful tracer when they can be found.  Below, we describe the first
detection of salts in a high-mass protostellar disk, unveiling what may
be the only molecules that specifically trace disks around high-mass stars.

% \rlp{the point of the Science version was that NaCl and KCl are potentially
% unique tracers of disks around massive stars -- this final sentence doesn't
% actually say that!}

% \bam{Did we check w/ Holger here to see where he thought
% the v=1 for NaCl was seen?  I still can't find a paper w/ it.  It's also
% probably not correct to cite my paper here - I haven't (yet) compiled
% vibrational information...} \ag{I haven't e-mailed him; you want to do that?
% I was just citing your paper since the information came from your brain...
% we ought to cite you somewhere, if not here}

% \bam{In HH80/81, or do you mean beyond
% this pair only disordered blends have been observed period, anywhere?}
% \ag{AFAIK, except for the HH80/81 and \sourcei disks, all disks around massive
% stars are ambiguous / not strictly disks.}

% In \citet{Ginsburg2018b}, we used lines of \water and one or
% more unknown species to measure the rotation curve of the disk around \sourcei.
% We have now identified these unknown lines as transitions of NaCl and KCl.

\section{Observations and Analysis}
\label{sec:observations}

% rlp: I have moved pieces of this paragraph - but not all of it - to later in this section
% The pure-rotational spectra of KCl and its rare isotopologues was reported by
% \citet{Caris2004a} up to 930~GHz.  Most isotopologues were measured up to the
% seventh excited vibrational state.  \citet{Caris2004a} also refine predictions
% for NaCl based on prior laboratory work (again to 930~GHz) reported by
% \citet{Caris2002a}.  The results of these works were then subsequently used by
% \citet{Barton2014a} to generate high-temperature line lists, primarily for use
% in exoplanet atmospheres, and includes over 10$^5$ transitions for each
% molecular species and isotopologue with levels up to $E_U\sim5\ee{4}$ K. The
% primary result for the purposes of this work is the prediction of frequencies
% in vibrational states higher than those measured in the laboratory. To our
% knowledge, prior to this work, no astronomical detections of vibrationally
% excited transitions of either of these species, or their isotopologues, have
% been reported.


The observations presented here are described in \citet{Ginsburg2018b} as part
of ALMA project 2016.1.00165.S.  We use the robust 0.5 weighted spectral cubes
from all three bands (B3 3.0 mm, B6 1.3 mm, B7 0.87 mm) for our spectroscopic analysis.

Appendix D of that paper describes the spectral extraction method, which we
summarize here.  We used the U232.511 line (which we now identify as NaCl v=1
J=18-17) to find the velocity centroid for each (spatial) pixel across the
\sourcei disk.  We shifted the spectrum along each such pixel to 0 \kms, then
averaged the shifted spectra over the region with significant emission in the
NaCl line.  The averaging area is approximately the extent of the continuum
disk, 0.03 square arcseconds, or about 4, 20, and 40  beam areas, resulting in
an improvement in the signal-to-noise of about $2\times$, $4\times$, and
$6\times$ respectively in Band 3, 6, and 7.  This stacked spectrum, shown in
Figures \ref{fig:spectrab3}-\ref{fig:spectrab7}, traces material just above and
below the optically thick continuum disk (Figure \ref{fig:spatial}).  Because
this procedure removes the rotational velocity field of the disk, lines in the
stacked spectrum are narrower than one would observe in a lower spatial
resolution observation of the disk.  One may think of the stacked spectrum as
the output of a matched filter that is optimized for detection of disk
emission.

% The stacked spectrum is equivalent to that
% obtained with a matched filter using a narrow (delta-function) filter at each
% position tuned to the appropriate centroid velocity.

% We have clearly identified the carrier of the majority of unidentified lines in
% the \citet{Ginsburg2018b} spectra (only 2-3 lines are unidentified in the B6/B7
% spectra, though there are several in B3 we have not identified).

In the appendix of \citet{Ginsburg2018b}, we listed over 20 unidentified 
lines in the B6 ALMA spectra, and commented that ``there is no
consistent pattern to the detected lines and no individual species can explain
more than a few of the observed lines.''  This statement was incorrect, as
there are obvious carriers for the majority of the unidentified lines that we
had simply overlooked: NaCl, KCl, and their isotopologues.  The
detected lines have amplitudes in the range 0.5-3 mJy \perbeam, corresponding
to brightness temperatures 5-20 K.  

In Figures \ref{fig:spectrab3}-\ref{fig:spectrab7}, we have labeled all of the
detections and marginal detections of salt lines, as well as the most prominent
outflow (e.g., SiO and H$_2$O) lines.  Only 2-3 emission lines are now
unidentified in the B6 and B7 spectra, though there are over a dozen in B3 that
we have not identified. 

We also tentatively identify broad lines at 229.7 GHz and 344.4 GHz as AlO.  If
the identification is correct, these lines are broad because of the rich
hyperfine spectrum of AlO.

% I count 15 unidentified emission lines in B3; I added "emission" above 
% because there are lots of unidentified absorption lines from foreground gas. - Dick

%We additionally labeled
%\emph{some} of the lines that were not detected because of severe confusion

In Tables \ref{tab:Na_detections_B3}-\ref{tab:K_detections_B7}, we list all
of the salt lines in vibrational energy levels up to v=8 that lie within our
observed bands and whether or not they were detected.  We employ the following
flag scheme: `D' for detection, `N' for nondetection, `Q' for questionable
(e.g., low signal-to-noise, but possibly detected, or in regions where the
noise is not Gaussian and may be affected by other lines).  We additionally
include a flag `C' for `confused', which we add to the flag string if the line
is blended with another brighter line of a different species.  There are robust
detections of about 60 lines, up to the v=6 vibrational level.

The majority of the NaCl and KCl lines that we detected are in excited
vibrational states.  Although transitions in higher vibrational states were
measured, and some reported, in \citet{Caris2004a}, these did not provide the
complete catalogs needed for this analysis, nor to our knowledge are these
catalogues available in any of the standard online databases \citep[i.e., CDMS,
SLAIM, JPL;][]{Muller2005a,Lovas2005b,Pickett1998a}.  We obtained the KCl
frequencies for these lines from the catalogs of \citet{Barton2014a}, which was
designed primarily for use in exoplanet atmospheres and includes over 10$^5$
transitions for each molecular species and isotopologue with levels up to
$E_U\sim5\ee{4}$ K, and the NaCl frequencies from \citet{Cabezas2016a}, who
provided more accurate potential energy and dipole moment functions. The
primary result of these catalogs for the purposes of this work is the
prediction of frequencies in vibrational states higher than those measured in
the laboratory. 
% \rlp{Would it be fair just to say that we used Cabezas for the NaCl
% frequencies and Barton for the KCl frequencies?}

% The results of these works were then subsequently used by
% \citet{Barton2014a} to generate high-temperature line lists, primarily for use
% in exoplanet atmospheres, and includes over 10$^5$ transitions for each
% molecular species and isotopologue with levels up to $E_U\sim5\ee{4}$ K. The
% primary result for the purposes of this work is the prediction of frequencies
% in vibrational states higher than those measured in the laboratory. 

% We therefore used the predictions from the \citet{Barton2014a} catalog
% to identify lines with vibrational states $v>2$ for KCl and $v>4$ for NaCl.  
% \rlp{There's a paper by Cabezas et al, ApJ 2016 that claims to derive highly
% accurate frequencies, A coefficients, etc for NaCl up to J=150 and v=8; how
% does that fit into this story??}
% \ag{Added a reference.  Mostly, they fit the CDMS/SLAIM catalogs.  I've also switched
% to using the Cabezas values in the tables for NaCl.}

In using these catalogs, we found a systematic discrepancy between the rest
frequencies reported by \citet{Barton2014a}, and those given by
\citet{Caris2004a} and \citet{Caris2002a} and the catalogs generated from them:
the KCl lines appear to be systematically offset by $\sim$15-20 \kms in the
Barton catalog.  The Barton data are also discrepant with the more recent
\citet{Cabezas2016a} work that cataloged only NaCl lines. The offset is a
function of the vibrational and rotational energy states, indicating that it
resulted from an incorrect rotational and/or distortion constant.  We correct
for this error by performing a bilinear fit in frequency as a function of $v_u$
and $J_u$.  In the transitions available in both catalogs the resulting
frequency differences are generally $<0.1$ \kms, which is more than sufficient
for a reliable match to our observational spectra.  We then applied these
fitted models to the higher-$v$ states tabulated by Barton to get corrected
rest frequencies for KCl, while for NaCl we used the \citet{Cabezas2016a}
values.  We note that the values printed in \citet{Barton2014a} differ from
those in the digital catalogs hosted on \url{exomol.com}, so we suspect the
error was merely a transcription error of some sort.
%A more detailed re-fitting and prediction of the frequencies is beyond the
%scope of this \emph{Letter}, but is certainly warranted for follow-up efforts.

% \textbf{\color{red} At the moment, all of the line frequencies are shifted
% to higher frequencies by 17 \kms (KCl) and 3 \kms (NaCl) because of a discrepancy
% between the \citep{Barton2014a} catalog line frequencies and those of CDMS,
% JPL, and SLAIM.  The latter three, catalogued in Splatalogue, agree, and they
% agree better with my measurements.}

%The low observed brightness temperatures suggest that the emission from

\section{Discussion}
NaCl and KCl have only been seen in a 
% small 
handful of other sources, all of
which were moderately high-mass evolved stars blowing off their envelopes.  The
known detections include the carbon star envelope IRC +10216
\citep{Cernicharo1987a,Agundez2012a,Zack2011a}, the post-AGB star envelope CRL 2688
\citep{Highberger2003a}, and the oxygen-rich evolved star envelopes of VY Canis
Majoris and IK Tauri \citep{Milam2007a,Kaminski2013a}. To our knowledge,
\sourcei is only the
fifth astronomical source in which KCl and NaCl have been detected.
The only previous detections of vibrationally excited NaCl were 
% of the v=1 line
in the v=1 level
in IRC+10216 \citep{Quintana-Lacaci2016a} and VY CMa \citep{Decin2016a}, 
% (\citealt{Agundez2012a} presented the most systematic study of salt lines, 
%which only included detections of v=0 rotational transitions),
while \sourcei exhibits clear emission up to v=6 in both NaCl and KCl.

In these evolved stars, v=0 rotational transitions of NaCl were observed
with rotational temperatures ${T_{rot}\sim70-100}$ K (IK Tau, VY CMa), inferred
local temperatures of $\sim200$ K in shocks (CRL 2688), and $T\approx700$ K  in
an expanding shell (IRC+10216).  Below, we attempt to determine the physical
conditions in the \sourcei salt emission regions.

\subsection{Spatial distribution of the salt emission}
\label{sec:wherefrom}
In \sourcei, the salt lines originate from the surface layers of the disk (the Band 7
lines exhibit NaCl emission peaks at $\pm0.032\arcsec=13$ AU above the disk),
% \citet{Ginsburg2018b} showed that these species come only from the disk's
% immediate surroundings, 
unlike SiO and \water that both exhibit high vertical extents consistent with
outflow \citep{Ginsburg2018b}.  No emission in the salt lines is observed
toward the optically thick continuum in the disk midplane (Figure
\ref{fig:spatial}).  
% Although the carriers of the lines were unassigned at the time, 
\citet{Ginsburg2018b} modeled the line emission now assigned to these salts as a
truncated Keplerian disk, finding that the radial distribution of the emission
has an inner cutoff $\approx35-40$ AU and an outer cutoff $\approx55-60$~AU.

% disk_predictions.py
The equilibrium temperature in this radius range can be computed assuming the central
source has a luminosity $L=10^4 \lsun = 4 \pi r^2 \sigma_{SB} T^4 $, where we
solve for temperature with $r$ at the inner and outer radius, giving $T_{eq} =
500-670$ K for $r=35-60$ AU, assuming the disk intercepts all of the starlight
at this radius.  More realistically, providing the opposite limiting case,
$T_{eq}=120-180$ K for a flat disk \citep[Eqn. 4 of][]{Chiang1997a}.  These
cooler temperatures are consistent with the observed brightness temperatures in
the outer part of the continuum disk (in Figure \ref{fig:spatial}, the \referee{Band 6
and 7} NaCl emission begins just beyond the $T=300$ K \referee{continuum}
contour), although the temperature in the inner portion of the disk reaches
$\gtrsim500$ K.

We also compare the salt emission locations to the SiO emission regions.
Figure \ref{fig:sioonnacl} shows the \mbox{SiO v=0 J=8-7} line, which is
thermally excited (it shows no sign of masing at any velocity) and traces the
outflow.  The \mbox{SiO v=5 J=8-7} line, with an upper state energy level of
8747 K, is also shown.  It clearly traces a smaller radius than the NaCl line,
but a similar height in the disk.  By contrast, the \mbox{SiO v=0 J=8-7}
emission, with $E_U=75$ K, starts above the vertical centroid of the NaCl line.
These spatial anticorrelations suggest that the difference between the
molecules' emission patterns is driven partly by excitation, since the salt
lines have upper state energy levels intermediate between the SiO v=0 and v=5
states and trace an intermediate region.

% \bam{This reads
% as a result, not as discussion, as there's no conclusion drawn here.  What does
% this result tell us?  Seems like we're saying that the production method for

\subsection{Excitation}
The detection of vibrationally excited transitions from v=0 to v=6 at similar
brightness suggests that the vibrational excitation temperature $T_{ex,vib}$ of
the molecules is high.  However, we see sharply decreasing populations in
the higher rotational levels, indicating a much lower $T_{ex,rot}$.
% Since the
% molecules are not characterized by a single $T_{ex}$, they may be excited by
% some non-thermal mechanism.

% We detect highly excited transitions of NaCl and KCl, many with Einstein A
% coefficients in the range $\sim0.01-0.1$ s$^{-1}$, suggesting they are
% radiatively rather than collisionally excited.

% These high excitation lines
% are unlikely to be excited by collisions, since the gas would have to be hot
% enough to excite molecules into states with $E_U > 2000$ K and would therefore
% likely be hot enough to dissociate the molecules {\color{red} It would be nice
% to back this up with numbers}.  Alternately, at high densities and more
% moderate temperatures, the salts would likely be absorbed into dust grains.

% We calculate the level population as
% \begin{equation}
%     N_u = \frac{8 \pi \nu k_B}{g_u c^2 h A_{ul}} \int T_A d\nu
% %    nline = 8 * np.pi * freq * constants.k_B / constants.h / Aul / constants.c**2
% %    # term2 = np.exp(-constants.h*freq/(constants.k_B*Tex)) -1
% %    # term2 -> kt / hnu
% %    # kelvin-hertz
% %    Khz = (kkms * (freq/constants.c)).to(u.K * u.MHz)
% %    return (nline * Khz / degeneracies).to(u.cm**-2)
% \end{equation}
% {\color{red} (this is mostly a sanity check)}

Within each vibrational state for which we observed several transitions, we attempt
to measure a rotational temperature.  For the KCl v=0 state, in which we have
detected 4 rotational transitions from $30 < E_U < 400$ K, the best fit
is $T_{rot}\sim105$ K (Figure
\ref{fig:rotationdiagrams}).  At such a low temperature, the populations of the
vibrationally excited states should be effectively zero.  

\begin{figure*}[!htp]

vibrational state can internally be explained reasonably well by a single
consistent rotation temperature in the range $T_{rot}\sim50-150$ K, the population
distribution between vibrational excitation states cannot.}
\label{fig:rotationdiagrams}
\end{figure*}


Similarly, for each rotational transition observed from multiple vibrational
levels, we measure a vibrational temperature.  We find values that range from
1000 to 5000 K, although these fits are subject to very large
uncertainties.
% the fits are consistent with any temperature within this range.
% (and, statistically but not physically, they are consistent with arbitrarily
% large excitation temperatures).  
There are also statistically significant
outliers from the single-temperature model, suggesting that the level
populations may not be well-characterized by a single temperature.

% The rotational temperatures are reasonably consistent with the lower bound
% disk temperatures at this radius, hinting that the salt emission lines are
% coming from somewhere below the surface of the disk.  If this is the case,
% there are likely to be few optical photons reaching the salt molecules,
% since those are readily absorbed by the small grains in the upper layers.


% Since the highest clearly detected energy state detected has $E_U\sim3000$ K
% (see Table \ref{tab:all_detections_B3}; the v=6 lines of NaCl have three
% J-transitions detected), the radiation field likely turns over at around this
% temperature, implying the presence of a slightly cooler radiation field than
% implied in \citet{Testi2010a}, but still much warmer than the equilibrium temperature
% of the disk at this radius.  
% However, it is also possible that the higher-excitation lines are simply too faint
% to be detected at our $\sim0.4$ mJy/\kms RMS limit.

% \subsubsection{Line Excitation Models}
Below, we explore several mechanisms for the observed line excitation:

\par{\textbf{(1) Collisional excitation by \hh.}} 
%
% \par{\textbf{(1) Collisional excitation sets the rotational temperatures, radiation
% sets the vibration:}}
% In Figure \ref{fig:rotationdiagrams}, we show that it is possible to acquire
% reasonable fits to the rotational transitions within a single vibrational state,
% obtaining $T_{ex,rot}\approx100-150$ K.  If we assume that the apparent consistency
% with a rotational temperature similar to the dust continuum temperature implies
% the rotational transitions are in local thermodynamic equilibrium with gas at 
% that temperature, we can infer a lower limit on the local density.
% However, we note that there may be unresolved excitation structure within our
% observations such that a single-zone, single temjperature model does not apply.
%
\citet{Quintana-Lacaci2016a} calculated collision rates for NaCl with He and
provided a Fortran code to compute those rates.  Typical collision rate
coefficients for \hbox{$\Delta$J=1} or \hbox{$\Delta$J=2} transitions are
$10^{-10}$~cm$^3$ \pers.  Making the usual assumption that the collision rates
with \hh are similar to those for He, we used RADEX \citep{van-der-Tak2007a} to
examine the excitation \footnote{The RADEX-compatible molecular data file
incorporating these coefficients is available from
\url{https://github.com/keflavich/SaltyDisk/blob/\githash/nacl.dat}}.
% For T=100 K, $\delta v=1$ \kms \perpc, $N_{NaCl}=10^{12}$ \persc,
% \footnote{\rlp{presumably,
% the fractional abundance doesn't matter when one is computing critical density;
% giving this value will create confusion; the linewidth also is questionable}
% \ag{The fractional abundance relative to the collision partner does matter,
% and the velocity gradient affects the optical depth.  These are fiducial,
% poorly-justified parameters, but I think they're a good first guess.}
% }
%The critical density is $n_{cr}\sim10^8$ \percc for the $v=0$
%states and $n_{cr}\sim10^{12}$ for the $v>=1$ states, where $v$ is the
%vibrational state quantum number.  These high critical densities effectively
%rule out collisional excitation producing vibrationally excited states,
%since at such high densities, the rotational $v=0$ states would necessarily
%be thermalized to the same temperature as the vibrational states, contrary
%to what we observe.

The NaCl transitions we observe have  Einstein A values in the range
$A\sim10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, while the vibrationally excited states have
infrared transitions with rates $A\sim1$ s$^{-1}$
\cite{Barton2014a,Cabezas2016a}.  The collision rates into the $v=0$ states are
$C\sim10^{-11}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ (insensitive to temperature), while collision
rates into $v>0$ states from $v=0$ states are lower, $C\sim10^{-13}-10^{-12}$
cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ at $T=1000$ K, but only $C < 10^{-15}$  cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ at
$T=100$ K \cite{Quintana-Lacaci2016a}.  Thus, extremely high gas temperatures
and densities would be required to collisionally excite a significant
population of the molecules into vibrational states; collisional excitation
alone also cannot explain different vibrational states being observed at a
similar brightness level.





\par{\textbf{(2) Collisional excitation by electrons.}} 
Because NaCl and KCl are extremely polar molecules, with dipole moments of 9.1
and 10.3 Debye, respectively \citep{Barton2014a}, collisions with electrons
could also be important.  Using the approximations from \citet{Dickinson1975a},
we find that collision rates between both NaCl and KCl and electrons in the
J=5-50 v=0 states are $C\approx10^{-5}$ cm$^{3}$ \pers.  Thus, electrons are
$10^5$ times as efficient at exciting these molecules than \hh. In typical
low-mass disks, ionization fractions $X_e \geq 10^{-4}$ occur in the upper
layers of the disk, where some UV radiation is able to ionize H and C
\citep{Bergin2007a}.  Collisions with electrons would dominate the excitation
of the salt lines in such regions.  However, deeper into the disks only X-rays
and cosmic rays can penetrate, resulting in fractional ionizations $X_e <
10^{-6}$, too small for electron collisions to be relevant. 

The low rotational temperatures that we infer seem to rule out both \hh and
electron collisional excitation of excited vibrational states, since a
collision rate high enough to excite these vibrational levels would quickly
thermalize their rotational ladders at high temperatures.


\par{\textbf{(3) Infrared excitation.}} 
The observed emission from vibrationally excited states suggests the
presence of a significant radiation field at 25-45 \um, which covers the range
of $\Delta v=1$ rovibrational transitions with $v\leq6$ (for NaCl, the range is
25-35 \um, for KCl, it is 35-45 \um).  Since the selection rules for these
transitions require that $\Delta v=1$ \footnote{Einstein A-values for the 
$\Delta v=2$ transitions are $\sim100$ times smaller than for the $\Delta v=1$
transitions, for which $A\sim1$ \pers.}, the radiation density must be high
enough to maintain a large population in the $v=1,
2, 3, 4, 5$ states such that some fraction of photons are able to excite
molecules to still higher states.  Such a strong radiation field would
be expected to thermalize the rotational ladders within each vibrational
state to the same high temperature, which is not observed.

We experimented with several RADEX models with varying backgrounds.  The
fiducial system, with a half-sky-filling $T_{bg}=200$ K (representing the
optically thick disk) and a dilute 4000 K radiation field $I_{\nu} = (100
\mathrm{R_\odot})^2 / (30 \mathrm{au})^2 B_\nu(4000 \mathrm{K})$ (representing
the star) reasonably predicts the $v=1$ and $v=0$ intensities, but
substantially underpredicts the $v>1$ intensities.  A stronger radiation
field in the 25-45 \um regime is required, but such a field cannot be
reasonably produced by combinations of blackbodies.  If there were a dust
emission feature in that range, such as crystalline silicates forsterite
and enstatite \citep[e.g.][]{Molster2005a}, that dominated the emission spectrum
in the far-infrared, it could potentially explain the observed vibrational
excitation patterns.  Alternatively, bright emission lines from other molecules,
such as water, in the mid-infrared might also drive the peculiar excitation.

To demonstrate that radiative excitation in the mid-infrared is a plausible
mechanism to explain the rotation diagrams, we performed additional RADEX
modeling in which we modified the background radiation field.  We adopted a
model with a dilute $150$K blackbody representing the disk, a very dilute 4000
K blackbody representing the star, plus a strong Gaussian feature centered at
29 \um with width 1 \um.  With this radiation field, the vibrational lines 
are highly excited and exhibit a vibrational temperature significantly higher
than the rotational temperature seen within any vibrational state.
We show one example model in Figure \ref{fig:naclexcitationmodel}.

explain the observed level populations.  The top panel shows the input radiation field as a blue

The bottom panel shows a level population diagram similar to Figure \ref{fig:rotationdiagrams}.

This toy model illustrates that it is possible, via radiative excitation, to obtain level
population ratios similar to those observed, but only with a peculiar radiation field\referee{; similar
experiments exploring a range of physical parameters with a blackbody radiation field could not reproduce
the different vibrational and rotational temperatures}.

\par{\textbf{(4) Ultraviolet excitation.}}
% In this model, collisions and infrared radiation can be ignored.  Instead,
% higher-energy photons are responsible for the excitation.  In order to directly
% excite the higher observed vibrationally excited states ($v\geq6$), 5 micron or
% shorter-wavelength photons are required.
%
% A model in which the excitation is driven by the radiation field at 4-10 microns,
% i.e., directly exciting the v=0 to the v=3-6 excitation states for NaCl,
% can be ruled out on the basis of the low interaction cross-sections of these
% transitions: they are highly forbidden, with transition probabilities $\sim10$
% orders of magnitude lower than the $\Delta v=1$ transitions.
%
The high vibrational and low rotational temperatures of the
salt lines resemble the `sawtooth' pattern observed for the rovibrational
populations of \hh toward the Orion bar photodissociation region.  This
pattern is explained by ultraviolet excitation into higher electronic states,
followed by decay back to excited vibrational levels in the ground electronic
state \citep{Kaplan2017a}.  \hh rotational populations in the ground vibrational
state are thermalized by collisions; UV excitation transposes this pattern into
higher vibrational states.
% without the $\Delta v=1$ restriction that applies to infrared excitation.

% Ultraviolet excitation into higher electronic states could explain the observed
% vibrationally excited emission.  Assuming that electronic states deexcite into
% random vibrational states, then trigger a subsequent cascade into the ground
% rotational and vibrational states, each UV photon would be responsible for emission
% spanning the full energy range.

Unfortunately, there are several problems applying this model to the salt lines.
First, we find an abrupt decline in the populations of $v > 6$ vibrational states,
with weak or ambiguous detections of NaCl in the v=7 and v=8 levels, and
nondetections for $v > 9$.  Unless there is
some selection effect in the electronic de-excitation disfavoring higher vibrational
states, it is difficult to explain this cutoff.  
Second, the lowest excited electronic energy levels for both NaCl and KCl are about
5 eV above the ground state, very close to the photodissociation threshold for these
molecules \citep{Zeiri1983, Silver1986}, which
may therefore be dissociated rather than excited by UV photons.
Third, there may not be any UV radiation in the outer disk where these lines
are detected.  
While UV
emission may be produced in shocks in the outflow, and $\sim5$ eV photons
could be produced by the central $\sim4000$ K photosphere \citep{Testi2010a},
it is unclear whether it could penetrate into the disk where the salt emission
is observed.  Even a light haze of dust in the upper layers of the disk would
likely shield the molecules from such illumination.

\par{\textbf{(5) Dust opacity.}}
\referee{
Finally, we consider a more mundane explanation that the apparently-steep
rotational temperatures are driven by high dust opacity at the higher
frequencies, either in the disk or in the foreground molecular cloud.
Because the vibrational temperatures are measured from lines within the same
ALMA band, they are unaffected by changes in opacity with frequency.
}

% measurements in continuum_measurements_linestack_region.py
\referee{
We measure the continuum within the spectral extraction region to have
a mean brightness temperature $T_B=210, 200$ and $220$ K in our 3 mm, 1.3 mm, and
870 \um data, respectively.  These values are equivalent to within
$\approx10\%$,
which is the approximate calibration uncertainty of ALMA.  If the foreground
cloud had significant optical depth, we
would expect the 870 \um brightness to be lower than the 3 mm; for dust with a
typical interstellar medium opacity index $\beta=1.75$, the dust should be
$\approx9\times$ optically thicker at
870 \um than at 3 mm.  Since we do not observe a lower
brightness temperature at higher frequency, we conclude that the foreground
cloud has a negligible effect on the observed line ratios.
}

% dust_opacity_test.py
\referee{
We attempt to evaluate the opacity within the salt-emitting portion of the disk.
However, we first note that the vertical profile of salt emission is unresolved,
so adopting the typical assumption that the disk has a column density that
exponentially decays vertically, the substructure within the beam is the
dominant uncertainty.  Despite this uncertainty, we can rule out opacity as the explanation of
the rotation temperatures by noting that
the KCl v=0 lines, which are the only vibrational state detected in all three observed
bands, have similar peak brightnesses at $\sim100$ and $\sim345$ GHz
($T_{B,max}(\textrm{KCl v=0 13-12}) = 15.3\pm0.9$ K and $T_{B,max}(\textrm{KCl
v=0 45-44}) = 9.7\pm1.8$ K).  However, at temperatures $T_{ex} > 140$ K, 
the expected intensity of the higher frequency line is greater, and at
the high observed vibrational temperatures $T_{vib} \sim 1000$ K, $T_{B}(\textrm{KCl
v=0 45-44}) \approx 9 \times T_{B}(\textrm{KCl v=0 13-12})$.
If we assume a dust opacity index $\beta=2$,
which is conservative in that it provides the greatest difference in opacity
between the two frequencies, the dust opacity required to produce the observed ratio
is $\tau_{345 \textrm{GHz}} = 2.8$ and $\tau_{100 \textrm{GHz}} = 0.2$.  These optical
depth differences in the dust would result in a substantially ($\approx4\times$) higher 
dust brightness at 0.85 \um than at 3 mm, which is not observed.  We therefore
rule out dust opacity within the disk as an explanation for the temperature
discrepancy.
}


\bigskip

We conclude that there is no simple model that explains the observed pattern of
low rotational and high vibrational temperature.



\subsection{What is producing gas-phase salts?}

Sodium and potassium are rarely observed in the dense molecular interstellar
medium.  They are usually assumed to be rapidly incorporated into dust grains
after being ejected from dying stars \citep[e.g.,][]{Milam2007a}.  Since we
observe NaCl and KCl in the atmosphere of the disk, it is clear that
there is a zone where either dust has not  formed  (which is not very likely
in a protostellar system)
or
where dust is destroyed and returned to the gas phase.  We argue that the dust
must be destroyed almost immediately as it is launched into the disk-driven
outflow \citep{Hirota2017b}. We evaluate three scenarios for salt production:
sputtering off of dust by high-energy particles, gas-phase formation from
atomic gas, and thermal desorption.


\textbf{(1) Sputtering:}
In the first scenario, NaCl and KCl molecules are sputtered from the grains.
The most plausible means to achieve the energies required to sputter grains is
with strong shocks \citep{Schilke1997a,Decin2016a}.  In \sourcei, it seems
unlikely that there would be very strong shocks in the disk, but there are
high-velocity shocks throughout the outflow.  Bright SiO emission is observed in
the inner part of the outflow (i.e., within $<100$ AU of \sourcei), suggesting
that grains are efficiently destroyed there.  Without knowing the grain
structure, however, it is unclear whether high-energy particles capable of
destroying the grain cores are present.

Since the salts are detected close to but above the disk midplane, the
grains must be sputtered very rapidly after being launched from the disk surface.
The lack of salt and SiO emission in the disk midplane may be because these
molecules are not in the gas phase at all in the midplane, although radiative
transfer can also easily explain their non-detection (i.e., the continuum
background is the same intensity as the emission lines).

\referee{
In this model, both SiO and the salts are in the gas phase outside of the disk
midplane, where we assume they are incorporated into dust grains.  However, the
SiO and NaCl have different morphology: low-J SiO lines are seen throughout the
outflow at very high elevations above the disk, while the salt lines are
limited to $\lesssim 30$ AU from the midplane.  Even the low-J salt lines,
which can be excited at similar modest densities ($n\sim10^4$ to $10^6$
\percc), are not observed at high elevations.  Excitation therefore cannot
explain the morphological difference between SiO and the salts, and instead we
infer that they are chemically distinct.  Possibilities include that the salts
deplete back onto grains as they are entrained in the outflow, or they react to
form other molecules, or they dissociate into atomic form while SiO remains
molecular.
}



\textbf{(2) Gas-phase formation:}
Gas-phase formation of NaCl and KCl is possible from ionized Na and K.
Potassium and sodium have similar first ionization potentials at 4.34 and 5.14
eV, respectively.  These atoms would be nearly fully ionized between 1500-2000
K at a density of $10^6$ \percc (Aluminum has a higher first ionization
potential of 5.99 eV, and so is ionized at a few hundred K higher temperatures
than sodium).  These ions react with HCl to form NaCl and KCl.  However, at
present, only the inner $<20$ AU region, which is currently unresolved, clearly
reaches such high temperatures\footnote{We also know from RRL studies that
there is little to no ionized gas with $T\gtrsim10^4$ K around \sourcei
\citep{Plambeck2016a,Baez-Rubio2018a}}.  

For gas-phase formation to be a significant process, then, either material in
that hot inner region is being transported outward, which seems unlikely since
there is a bulk outflow lifting material off of the disk, or the disk was
previously substantially warmer.  Under the dynamical formation scenario of the
disk, in which it is the remnant of a previously larger disk from the
\sourcei-BN interaction \citep{Bally2017a,Luhman2017a}, a great deal of kinetic
energy was released as the disk re-settled into its current apparently smooth
state, which could have resulted in much higher gas temperatures over the last
few hundred years.  This scenario would imply that the observable state of NaCl
and KCl is very short lived, as these molecules are in the process of depleting
onto grains.  While plausible, there are many processes that need to coincide
perfectly in this scenario (disk temperature history, gas density, gas-phase
formation rates), so we favor the dust destruction hypotheses.

We note that, if the formation rates of NaCl and KCl are very high, it is
possible that the vibrational excitation observed is from the chemical energy
of formation.  However, because of the short expected lifetimes of the
vibrationally excited states, we regard this explanation for the excitation as
very unlikely.


\textbf{(3) Thermal desorption from grain surfaces}
\citet{Decin2016a} presented a model for the gas-phase abundance of
NaCl in which it is thermally desorbed from grains at grain temperatures
between 100 and 300 K, depending on the unknown binding energy of NaCl with
the grain surface.  Since we expect grain temperatures $T>150$ K in the
NaCl emission region (see Section \ref{sec:wherefrom}), this model hints
that simple grain heating is enough to explain the high gas-phase abundances
of NaCl observed.  Since NaCl is not observed within $r<30 AU$, though,
it must be dissociated at smaller radii, which most likely requires
a substantial UV field within that radius in the wavelength range
$912 \mathrm{\AA} < \lambda < 3000 \mathrm{\AA}$ \citep{Silver1986a}.

This model is plausible, though it relies on unknown physical parameters.
Additionally, while a 4000 K stellar atmosphere \citep{Testi2010a} produces
non-negligible radiation short of 3000 \AA, it is unclear whether that
radiation can propagate to the part of the disk where the salts are observed,
since small dust grains may pervade the system.


\subsection{Other salts}
While NaCl and KCl are clearly detected here, there are also several
transitions of AlCl and AlF in our observational bands that were not detected.
\citet{Cernicharo1987a} detected these transitions at comparable brightness to
NaCl and KCl in IRC+10216.  The lack of AlCl may be because \sourcei's disk is
oxygen-rich, and aluminum is locked into AlOH, as suggested in the
\citet{Cherchneff2012a} model.  Indeed, the tentative detection of AlO
in our spectra supports this conclusion.
%\rlp{Highberger et al 2003 note lack of AlCl toward CRL2688; but they remark
%on ubiquity of NaCN, which also is seen toward IRC10216; do we have nondetections
%of NaCN in our band?}\ag{Yes, NaCN is in-band and nondetected.}



\subsection{Isotopologue abundances}
With several transitions of each of the observed isotopologues, we can in
principle measure the relative abundance of the various isotopes.  However,
because of the uncertainties in the excitation above, these measurements should
be taken with a grain of salt.

The $^{37}$Cl abundance can be measured by comparing the intensity of the NaCl
and Na$^{37}$Cl v=3 J=7-6, v=4 J=8-7 and J=7-6, and v=5 J=7-6 lines
\referee{assuming they are optically thin}.  The ratio $^{35}$/$^{37}$Cl is
$r=1.4\pm0.4$.  The KCl v=0 J=45-44 line gives a $^{35}/^{37}$Cl ratio $r=0.8$.
\citet{Agundez2012a} measured this ratio to be $r=2.9\pm0.3$ in IRC+10216, and
\citet{Highberger2003a} reported a ratio of 2.1 $\pm$ 0.8 in CRL 2688.  Our
measurement is somewhat lower, but should be regarded as consistent at least
until we can obtain more accurate column density measurements. 


We only have one commonly observed $^{41}$KCl / $^{39}$KCl line, v=0 J=13-12,
which has a ratio $^{39}/^{41}$ $r=2.4$. 


\subsection{Future prospects}
The detection of these refractory species in the gas phase in the atmosphere
of \sourcei's disk hints that other refractory molecules may be present, 
which could enable their first detection in the ISM (e.g., such rare species as
FeO and FeS), and may enable direct measurements of the metallicity in
star-forming gas.

The observed NaCl and KCl transitions uniquely trace the disk, unlike most other
molecules observed in the ISM that are bright and abundant in hot cores like
Sgr B2 \citep{Nummelin1998a,Belloche2013a}.  These lines therefore potentially
represent tracers that can uniquely trace high-mass disks, making them extremely
valuable probes of early-stage high-mass star formation\referee{, at least at
distances where the salt-emitting regions can be resolved}.
However, it remains unclear whether \sourcei is a unique source or is
representative of the class of high-mass protostars with disks; if the latter,
these lines and potentially many others can be used to probe the radiation
environment of extremely embedded high-mass protostars.  An obvious next step
is to search for these lines in other resolved disks around high-mass
protostars \citep[e.g.  HH80/81;][]{Girart2017a}.  These species are
particularly interesting for future millimeter and centimeter wavelength
observatories like the ngVLA and SKA, since they have lower-J transitions into
the few centimeter range, wavelengths at which the dust is very likely
to be optically thin even in the inner few AU of a disk.

The detection of these species with substantial population in vibrationally
excited states highlights the need for laboratory work to measure such
transitions in known astronomical molecular species. Indeed, prior work on
vibrational excitation in modeling and assigned vibrationally excited ethyl
cyanide in ALMA observations of Orion-KL revealed that even when catalogs for
these states are available, they are often incomplete \citep{Fortman2012a}.

\section{Conclusions}
We have identified many transitions of NaCl, KCl, and their isotopologues in
the disk of \sourcei.  These lines trace material very near the surface of the
disk, providing a uniquely powerful probe of the disk kinematics and physical
conditions.

Despite the wide range of transitions observed, the excitation mechanism and
conditions remain uncertain.  Further observations of lower-energy vibrational
and rotational states of these molecules will help distinguish between
radiative and collisional excitation scenarios and will either provide
direct measurements of the density or the radiation field in the 30-60 AU
region around \sourcei.

The narrow vertical extent of the salt emission indicates that dust is
destroyed nearly immediately after being raised from the surface of the disk.
This hints that immediate dust destruction is an integral part of the outflow
driving process.

Given the rarity of these molecules, if they can be detected elsewhere,
they will serve as a powerful and unique probe of local conditions.
They may be the best available molecular tool to find disks around high-mass
protostars and measure their kinematics.  

%These lines trace a rare physical phenomenon.  They are therefore an excellent
%tracer
%of this phenomenon, assuming they are detected
