Disks around high-mass stars have been difficult to identify and observe, in
part because most emission lines do not uniquely trace the disk.  Observing
disks around more massive stars is the critical test of whether star formation
theories developed on low-mass stars apply at higher masses.  We present the
discovery that two molecular species, NaCl and KCl, trace the disk around the
15 \msun protostellar system Orion Source I.  These molecules have previously
only been detected in the atmospheres of dying stars, so they are rare enough
to be unique tracers of the disk alone.  We have also detected highly
vibrationally excited lines of these species that have never before been
observed.  These salts provide the best hope for unambiguous measurements
of disk properties in the high-mass regime.



Disks are ubiquitous around forming stars.  They provide the main mechanism
for mediating accretion.  However, it remains uncertain whether they play
an important role in high-mass star formation, since the only definitive
disk detections are around stars that have already acquired most of their
mass \citep{Girart2017a,Ginsburg2018b}.  The lack of clear disk detections
is, at least in part, because there were no known spectral lines that trace
a disk and not the molecule-rich ``hot core'' in the surrounding region
\citep{Goddi2018a,Cesaroni2017a}.  The central disks may also be obscured
by dust opacity at wavelengths less than 3 mm.


While dozens of species have been detected in the disks around low-mass stars
\citep{McGuire2018c}, these molecules have all consisted of a few constituents:
H, C, N, O, and S.  All of the molecules seen in disks are also prevalent
in the ISM, particularly in the hot cores surrounding high-mass stars
\citep{some sgr b2 reference}.

More exotic molecules are seen in the atmospheres of dying stars.  Stars along
the asymptotic giant branch lose substantial mass in slow winds
\citep{Herwig2005a}, which form molecules with high atomic weight atoms that
rapidly condense onto dust particles.  In IRC+10216, the expanding gas cloud
around CW Leonis, NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, NaCN, and several other metal-bearing
molecules have been detected \citep{Agundez2012a,Zack2011a}.  NaCl and KCl have
been detected around other AGB and post-AGB stars
\citep{Milam2007a,Highberger2003a,Sanchez-Contreras2018a}, but never elsewhere
in space.

We report the serendipitous detection of NaCl, KCl, and their $^{37}Cl$ and
$^{41}$K isotopologues in the disk around Orion Source I.  This disk was
previously used to measure the central mass of Source I as 15 \msun, though
those measurements were performed in ignorance of the carrier molecules
\citep{Ginsburg2018b}.  Source I is the brightest object in the Orion nebula
at millimeter wavelengths and is deeply embedded within a hot core \citep{};
it is not directly detected in the mid-infrared \citep[e.g.,][]{Robberto2005a}.
It is a system consisting of a $\sim10^4$ \lsun central object with a photospheric
temperature $\approx4000$ K \citep{Testi2010a} surrounded by a $\sim0.1$ \msun
disk \citep{Plambeck2016a}.  The central source mass has been debated,
with estimates ranging from 7-20 \msun \citep{Matthews2010a,other}, but the
highest-resolution data imply a central source mass $M\approx15$ \msun from
fitting a Keplerian orbital model to \water and NaCl emission profiles
\citep{Ginsburg2018b}.

We performed observations with ALMA in three spectral bands at the highest
available spatial resolution, 0.03 to 0.10 arcseconds from 0.85 to 3 mm.
The spectral resolution ranged from 1.5-6.5 \kms over the same range. 
We noted a distinctive morphology in the position-velocity diagrams of several
lines, showing a clear linear gradient in velocity parallel to the disk.
To obtain higher signal-to-noise in our extracted spectra, we shifted
the spectra by their measured centroid velocities and averaged them together,
obtaining a disk-averaged spectrum.  We use this spectrum to measure and 
identify lines.

While the most prominent spectral features are the SiO and \water lines that
have previously been observed \citep{Goddi2013a,Hirota2014a}, there are dozens
of lines that previously remained unidentified \citep{Ginsburg2018b}.  We
identified these lines as transitions of NaCl and KCl, noting the excellent
correspondence between their locations and catalogued frequencies
\citep{Caris2002a,Caris2004a,Muller2005a,Lovas2005a,Pickett1998a}.   We
additionally searched databases of higher-excitation transitions of these same
species, finding additional matches \citep{Barton2014a,Cabezas2016a}.


Though the detection of salts lines in a protostellar disk was surprising, 
the detection of highly vibrationally excited transitions of these species
is even more so.  The detected transitions have upper-state energy levels
up to
