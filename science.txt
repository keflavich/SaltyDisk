submit to one of these journals and are turned down, this can be a summary we
pass off to NRAO for a press release.


Disks around high-mass stars have been difficult to identify and observe, in
part because most emission lines do not uniquely trace the disk.  Observing
disks around more massive stars is the critical test of whether star formation
theories developed on low-mass stars apply at higher masses.  We present the
discovery that two molecular species, NaCl and KCl, trace the disk around the
15 \msun protostellar system Orion Source I.  These molecules have previously
only been detected in the atmospheres of dying stars, so they are rare enough
to be unique tracers of the disk alone.  We have also detected highly
vibrationally excited lines of these species that have never before been
observed.  These salts provide the best hope for unambiguous measurements
of disk properties in the high-mass regime.
