  abstract =      {We report new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter
                   Array (ALMA) observations of a circumstellar disk
                   around Source I in Orion KL, an archetype of massive
                   protostar candidates. We detected two ortho-H2O lines
                   at 321 GHz (102, 9-93, 6) and 336 GHz (nu2 = 1, 52,
                   3-61, 6) for the first time in Source I. The latter
                   one is in a vibrationally excited state at the lower
                   state energy of 2939 K, suggesting evidence of hot
                   molecular gas close to Source I. The integrated
                   intensity map of the 321 GHz line is elongated along
                   the bipolar outflow while the 336 GHz line map is
                   unresolved with a beam size of 0.''4. Both of these
                   maps show velocity gradients perpendicular to the
                   bipolar outflow. The velocity centroid map of the 321
                   GHz line implies a spatial and velocity structure
                   similar to that of vibrationally excited SiO masers
                   tracing the root of the outflow emanating from the
                   disk surface. In contrast, the 336 GHz line is most
                   likely emitting from the disk midplane with a
                   diameter of 0.''2 (84 AU) as traced by radio
                   continuum emission and a dark lane devoid of the
                   vibrationally excited SiO maser emission. The
                   observed velocity gradient and the spectral profile
                   of the 336 GHz H2O line can be reconciled with a
                   model of an edge-on ring-like structure with an
                   enclosed mass of >7 M &sun; and an excitation
                   temperature of >3000 K. The present results provide
                   further evidence of a hot and neutral circumstellar
                   disk rotating around Source I with a diameter of ~100
                   AU scale.},

  abstract =      {Orion Source I (``SrcI'') is the protostar at the
                   center of the Kleinmann-Low Nebula. ALMA observations
                   of SrcI with 0."2 angular resolution were made at 350
                   and 660 GHz to search for the H26alpha and H21alpha
                   hydrogen recombination lines and to measure the
                   continuum flux densities. The recombination lines
                   were not detected, ruling out the possibility that
                   SrcI is a hypercompact H II region. The deconvolved
                   size of the continuum source is approximately 0."23
                   × 0."07 (˜100 × 30 au); it is interpreted as a
                   disk viewed almost edge-on. Optically thick thermal
                   emission from ˜500 K dust is the most plausible
                   source of the continuum, even at frequencies as low
                   as 43 GHz; the disk mass is most likely in the range
                   0.02-0.2 {M}&sun; . A rich spectrum of molecular
                   lines is detected, mostly from sulfur- and
                   silicon-rich molecules like SO, SO2, and SiS, but
                   also including vibrationally excited CO and several
                   unidentified transitions. Lines with upper energy
                   levels {E}{{U}}\gt 500 K appear in emission and are
                   symmetric about the source's LSR velocity of 5 {km}
                   {{{s}}}-1, while lines with {E}{{U}}\lt 500 K appear
                   as blueshifted absorption features against the
                   continuum, indicating that they originate in
                   outflowing gas. The emission lines exhibit a velocity
                   gradient along the major axis of the disk that is
                   consistent with rotation around a 5-7 {M}&sun;
                   central object. The relatively low mass of SrcI and
                   the existence of a 100 au disk around it are
                   difficult to reconcile with the model in which SrcI
                   and the nearby Becklin-Neugebauer Object were ejected
                   from a multiple system 500 years ago.},

                   continuum and spectral line emission from SrcI's
                   disk. We also detect a central weakly resolved source
                   that we interpret as a hot spot in the inner disk,
                   which may indicate the presence of a binary system.
                   The high angular resolution and sensitivity of these
                   observations allows us to measure the outer envelope
                   of the rotation curve of the H2O 55,0--64,3 line,
                   which gives a mass M I ≈ 15 $\pm$ 2 {M}o . We
                   detected several other lines that more closely trace
                   the disk, but were unable to identify their parent
                   species. Using centroid-of-channel methods on these

                   dynamical decay of a multiple-star system ~500 years

                   BN/KL from 42.3 to 43.6 GHz with the Green Bank
                   Telescope. Sixty-seven lines were identified and
                   ascribed to 13 different molecular species. The
                   spectrum at 7 mm is dominated by SiO, SO2, CH3OCH3,
                   and C2H5CN. Five transitions have been detected from
                   the SiO isotopologues 28SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO. We
                   report here for the first time the spectra of the
                   29SiO and 30SiO v = 0 J = 1-0 emission in Orion
                   BN/KL, and show that they have double-peaked profiles
                   with velocity extents similar to the main
                   isotopologue. The main motivation for the survey was
                   the search of high-velocity (100-1000 km s-1)
                   outflows in the BN/KL region as traced by SiO Doppler
                   components. Some of the unidentified lines in
                   principle could be high-velocity SiO features, but
                   without imaging data their location cannot be
                   established. Wings of emission are present in the v =
                   0 28SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO profiles, and we suggest
                   that the v = 0 emission from the three isotopologues
                   might trace a moderately high-velocity (~30-50 km
                   s-1) component of the flows around the high-mass
                   protostar Source I in the Orion BN/KL region. We also
                   confirm the 7 mm detection of a complex
                   oxygen-bearing species, acetone (CH3COCH3), which has
                   been recently observed toward the hot core at 3 mm,
                   and have found further indications of the presence of
                   long cyanopolyynes (HC5N and HC7N) in the quiescent

                   emission toward the massive young stellar object
                   (YSO) Orion Source I. Both SiO transitions were
                   observed simultaneously with an angular resolution of
                   ~0.5 mas (~0.2 AU for d = 414 pc) and a spectral
                   resolution of ~0.2 km s-1. Here we explore the global
                   properties and kinematics of the emission through two
                   19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months (from
                   2001 March 19 to 2002 December 10). These movies
                   provide the most detailed view to date of the
                   dynamics and temporal evolution of molecular material
                   within ~20-100 AU of a massive (gsim8 M sun) YSO. As
                   in previous studies, we find that the bulk of the SiO
                   masers surrounding Source I lie in an X-shaped locus;
                   the emission in the south and east arms is
                   predominantly blueshifted, and emission in the north
                   and west is predominantly redshifted. In addition,
                   bridges of intermediate-velocity emission are
                   observed connecting the red and blue sides of the
                   emission distribution. We have measured proper
                   motions of over 1000 individual maser features and
                   found that these motions are characterized by a
                   combination of radially outward migrations along the
                   four main maser-emitting arms and motions tangent to
                   the intermediate-velocity bridges. We interpret the
                   SiO masers as arising from a wide-angle bipolar wind
                   emanating from a rotating, edge-on disk. The
                   detection of maser features along extended, curved
                   filaments suggests that magnetic fields may play a
                   role in launching and/or shaping the wind. Our
                   observations appear to support a picture in which
                   stars with masses as high as at least 8 M sun form
                   via disk-mediated accretion. However, we cannot yet
                   rule out that the Source I disk may have been formed
                   or altered following a recent close encounter.},

                   observational constraints on disk-mediated accretion
                   in this context have been scarce, largely owing to
                   difficulties in probing the circumstellar gas at

                   evolution of the circumstellar gas within 1000 AU

                   observations of v=1,2 SiO masers over ~2 years, we
                   produced a movie of bulk gas flow tracing the compact
                   disk and the base of the protostellar wind at radii <
                   100 AU from Source I. In addition, we have used the
                   VLA to map 7mm SiO v=0 emission and track proper
                   motions over 10 years. We identify a narrowly
                   collimated outflow with a mean motion of 18 km/s at
                   radii 100-1000 AU, along a NE-SW axis perpendicular

                   from ALMA observations}},
  volume =        {602},

  abstract =      {Context. Circumstellar discs around massive stars
                   could mediate the accretion onto the star from the
                   infalling envelope, and could minimize the effects of
                   radiation pressure. Despite such a crucial role, only
                   a few convincing candidates have been provided for
                   discs around deeply embedded O-type (proto)stars.
                   Aims: In order to establish whether disc-mediated
                   accretion is the formation mechanism for the most
                   massive stars, we have searched for circumstellar,
                   rotating discs around a limited sample of six
                   luminous (>105L&sun;) young stellar objects. These
                   objects were selected on the basis of their IR and
                   radio properties in order to maximize the likelihood
                   of association with disc+jet systems. Methods: We
                   used ALMA with 0.̋2 resolution to observe a large
                   number of molecular lines typical of hot molecular
                   cores. In this paper we limit our analysis to two
                   disc tracers (methyl cyanide, CH3CN, and its
                   isotopologue, 13CH3CN), and an outflow tracer
                   (silicon monoxide, SiO). Results: We reveal many
                   cores, although their number depends dramatically on
                   the target. We focus on the cores that present
                   prominent molecular line emission. In six of these a
                   velocity gradient is seen across the core,three of
                   which show evidence of Keplerian-like rotation. The
                   SiO data reveal clear but poorly collimated bipolar
                   outflow signatures towards two objects only. This can
                   be explained if real jets are rare (perhaps
                   short-lived) in very massive objects and/or if
                   stellar multiplicity significantly affects the
                   outflow structure.For all cores with velocity
                   gradients, the velocity field is analysed through
                   position-velocity plots to establish whether the gas
                   is undergoing rotation with nurot ∝ R- alpha, as
                   expected for Keplerian-like discs. Conclusions: Our
                   results suggest that in three objects we are
                   observing rotation in circumstellar discs, with three
                   more tentative cases, and one core where no evidence
                   for rotation is found. In all cases but one, we find
                   that the gas mass is less than the mass of any
                   embedded O-type star, consistent with the (putative)
                   discs undergoing Keplerian-like rotation. With the
                   caveat of low number statistics, we conclude that the
                   disc detection rate could be sensitive to the
                   evolutionary stage of the young stellar object. In
                   young, deeply embedded sources, the evidence for
                   discs could be weak because of confusion with the
                   surrounding envelope, while in the most evolved
                   sources the molecular component of the disc could
                   have already been dispersed. Only in those objects
                   that are at an intermediate stage of the evolution
                   would the molecular disc be sufficiently prominent
                   and relatively less embedded to be detectable by
                   mm/submm observations.},

  abstract =      {Understanding the formation of massive stars is one
                   of the unsolved problems in modern astronomy. The
                   main difficulty is that the intense radiation from
                   the high-luminosity stars and the thermal pressure
                   from the resulting ionized gas (both insignificant
                   for low-mass stars) may be able to reverse the
                   accretion flow and prevent the star from accreting
                   fresh material. Such feedback effects can naturally
                   be mitigated if accretion proceeds through discs,
                   which is the established mechanism to form sun-like
                   stars. However, recent 3D MHD simulations have shown
                   that accretion on 1000 au scales is through filaments
                   rather than a large disc. This theoretical prediction
                   has never been confirmed via observations owing to
                   the poor linear resolution of previous studies (>1000
                   au). Here we present the first observational evidence
                   that mass assembly in young high-mass stars forming
                   in protoclusters is predominantly asymmetric and
                   disordered. In particular, we observed the innermost
                   regions around three deeply embedded high-mass
                   protostars with very high spatial resolution (~100
                   au). We identified multiple massive (several solar
                   masses), warm (50-150 Kelvin) filamentary streamers
                   pointing onto the central sources, which we interpret
                   as multi-directional accretion channels. These
                   structures inhibit the formation of a large, steady
                   disc. Nevertheless, the identification of fast
                   collimated outflows in the three observed systems
                   indicates that (non-steady) compact discs may be
                   present (we measure upper limits on their radii of
                   <80 for one object and <350 astronomical units for
                   the remaining two objects). Our finding contrasts
                   with the simplified classic paradigm of an ordered
                   (and stable) disc/jet system and provides an
                   experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and
                   unsteady accretion model for massive star formation
                   supported by recent 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic
                   simulations.},

                   were observed toward IK Tau, using the telescopes of

                   narrow relative to those of other molecules,
                   indicating that sodium chloride has not reached the
                   terminal outflow velocity in either star, likely a
                   result of early condensation onto grains. Modeling
                   the observed spectra suggests abundances, relative to
                   H2, of f~5×10-9 in VY CMa and f~4×10-9 in IK Tau,

                   predicted fractional abundances in good agreement

                   that crystalline salt may be an important condensate

                   is confined to within a few arcseconds of the star. A
                   high degree of excitation is required for the
                   transitions observed for NaCl and NaCN; therefore,
                   these two species likely arise in the region where
                   the high-velocity outflow has collided with the
                   remnant wind. Here the effects of shocks and clumping
                   due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities have raised the
                   densities and temperatures significantly. The shell
                   source is thus likely to be clumpy and irregular. The
                   chemistry producing the sodium compounds is
                   consequently more complex than simple LTE formation.
                   Abundances of NaCl and NaCN, relative to H2, are
                   f~1.6×10-10 and ~5.2×10-9, respectively, while the
                   upper limit to AlCl is f<2×10-9. These values differ
                   substantially from those in IRC +10216, where AlCl
                   has an abundance near 10-7. The NaCl observations
                   additionally indicate a chlorine isotope ratio of
                   35Cl/37Cl=2.1+/-0.8 in CRL 2688, suggestive of
                   s-process enhancement of chlorine 37.},

                   observations of OH 231.8+4.2, a well studied bipolar
                   nebula around an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star.
                   The high angular resolution (~0.2-0.3 arcsec) and
                   sensitivity of our ALMA maps provide the most
                   detailed and accurate description of the overall
                   nebular structure and kinematics of this object to
                   date. We have identified a number of outflow
                   components previously unknown. Species studied in
                   this work include 12CO, 13CO, CS, SO, SO2, OCS, SiO,
                   SiS, H3O+, Na37Cl, and CH3OH. The molecules Na37Cl
                   and CH3OH are first detections in OH 231.8+4.2, with
                   CH3OH being also a first detection in an AGB star.
                   Our ALMA maps bring to light the totally unexpected
                   position of the mass-losing AGB star (QX Pup)
                   relative to the large-scale outflow. QX Pup is
                   enshrouded within a compact (<60 AU) parcel of dust
                   and gas (clump S) in expansion (V~5-7 km/s) that is
                   displaced by 0.6arcsec to the south of the dense
                   equatorial region (or waist) where the bipolar lobes
                   join. Our SiO maps disclose a compact bipolar outflow
                   that emerges from QX Pup's vicinity. This outflow is
                   oriented similarly to the large-scale nebula but the
                   expansion velocities are about ten times lower (~35
                   km/s). We deduce short kinematical ages for the SiO
                   outflow, ranging from ~50-80 yr, in regions within
                   ~150 AU, to ~400-500 yr at the lobe tips (~3500 AU).
                   Adjacent to the SiO outflow, we identify a
                   small-scale hourglass-shaped structure
                   (mini-hourglass) that is probably made of compressed
                   ambient material formed as the SiO outflow penetrates
                   the dense, central regions of the nebula. The lobes
                   and the equatorial waist of the mini-hourglass are
                   both radially expanding with a constant velocity
                   gradient. The mini-waist is characterized by
                   extremely low velocities, down to ~1 km/s at ~150 AU,
                   which tentatively suggest the presence of a stable
                   structure. (abridged)},

                   have been investigated in recent years leading to
                   improved and refined models, for example with regard
                   to hot-bottom burning or the third dredge-up. The

                   results that reproduce many observations. However,
                   these and most other processes in AGB stars are
                   intimately related to the physics of stellar mixing.
                   Mixing in AGB stars is currently not well-enough
                   understood for accurate yield predictions. Several
                   constraints and methods are available to improve the
                   models. Some regimes of AGB evolution have not yet
                   been studied in sufficient detail. These include the
                   super-AGB stars and AGB stars at extremely low or

                   established Hamiltonian models to ensure entries that
                   are as reliable as possible. Separate entries are

                   vibrational states (except for diatomics) as far as
                   appropriate. The catalog is updated continuously.
                   More than 300 entries are available as of April 2005.
                   Examples of recently included light hydride species,

                   and complex molecules will be listed, and the need

                   e. g. using resources other than the CDMS catalog in
                   the search and conversion routines and creating more
                   entries involving rovibrational transitions.
                   Transition frequencies are available not only for
                   species detected in space but also for compounds that
                   may be detected in the future. Therefore, the catalog
                   is an ideal tool for analyzing line surveys and for
                   searching for new molecules in space. In addition,

                   41K37Cl are considered. Laboratory data were used to
                   refine ab initio potential energy curves in order to
                   compute accurate ro-vibrational energy levels.
                   Einstein A coefficients are generated using newly
                   determined ab initio dipole moment curves calculated
                   using the CCSD(T) method. New Dunham Yij constants
                   for KCl are generated by a re-analysis of a published
                   Fourier transform infrared emission spectra.
                   Partition functions plus full line lists of
                   ro-vibration transitions are made available in an
                   electronic form as supplementary data to this paper

  abstract =      {Context. The inner layers of circumstellar envelopes
                   around asymptotic giant branch stars are sites where
                   a variety of processes such as thermochemical
                   equilibrium, shocks induced by the stellar pulsation,
                   and condensation of dust grains determine the
                   chemical composition of the material that is expelled
                   into the outer envelope layers and, ultimately, into
                   interstellar space. Aims: We aim at studying the
                   abundances, throughout the whole circumstellar
                   envelope of the carbon star IRC +10216, of several
                   molecules formed in the inner layers in order to
                   constrain the different processes at work in such
                   regions. Methods: Observations towards IRC +10216 of
                   CS, SiO, SiS, NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN have
                   been carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope in the
                   80-357.5 GHz frequency range. A large number of
                   rotational transitions covering a wide range of
                   energy levels, including highly excited vibrational
                   states, are detected in emission and serve to trace
                   different regions of the envelope. Radiative transfer
                   calculations based on the LVG formalism have been
                   performed to derive molecular abundances from the
                   innermost out to the outer layers. The excitation
                   calculations include infrared pumping to excited
                   vibrational states and inelastic collisions, for
                   which up-to-date rate coefficients for rotational
                   and, in some cases, ro-vibrational transitions are
                   used. Results: We find that in the inner layers CS,
                   SiO, and SiS have abundances relative to H2 of 4 ×
                   10-6, 1.8 × 10-7, and 3 × 10-6, respectively, and
                   that CS and SiS have significant lower abundances in
                   the outer envelope, which implies that they actively
                   contribute to the formation of dust. Moreover, in the
                   inner layers, the amount of sulfur and silicon in gas
                   phase molecules is only 27% for S and 5.6% for Si,
                   implying that these elements have already condensed
                   onto grains, most likely in the form of MgS and SiC.
                   Metal-bearing molecules lock up a relatively small
                   fraction of metals, although our results indicate
                   that NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN, despite their
                   refractory character, are not significantly depleted
                   in the cold outer layers. In these regions a few
                   percent of the metals Na, K, and Al survive in the
                   gas phase, either in atomic or molecular form, and
                   are therefore available to participate in the gas
                   phase chemistry in the outer envelope. Based on

                   been detected in the envelope of the carbon-rich
                   asymptotic giant branch star, IRC+10216. This work is
                   the first definitive detection of an iron-bearing
                   molecule in the interstellar medium and is based on
                   newly measured rest frequencies. Eight successive
                   rotational transitions of this linear free radical in
                   the lowest spin ladder, Omega = 7/2, were observed at
                   2 and 3 mm using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO)
                   12 m telescope. Three transitions appear as single,
                   unblended features at the 1-2 mK level and exhibit
                   characteristic IRC+10216 line profiles; one had
                   previously been observed with the IRAM 30 m
                   telescope. Two other transitions are partially
                   blended, but exhibit distinct emission at the FeCN
                   frequencies. The remaining transitions are either
                   completely contaminated, or are too high in energy.
                   Comparison of the ARO and IRAM data suggests a source
                   size for FeCN of ~30'' in IRC+10216, indicating an
                   outer shell distribution, as expected for a free
                   radical. The column density derived for FeCN is N tot
                   = 8.6 × 1011 cm-2 with a rotational temperature of T
                   rot = 21 K. The fractional abundance of this molecule
                   is [FeCN]/[H2] ~ 2-7 × 10-10---comparable to that of
                   MgCN and KCN in IRC+10216. FeCN is likely formed by
                   gas-phase reactions of Fe+ or neutral iron; the
                   latter has a significant gas-phase abundance in the
                   outer shell. The detection of FeCN is further
                   evidence that metal cyanides/isocyanides dominate the
                   chemistry of refractory elements in IRC+10216.},

                   allowing us to study the innermost regions of the
                   circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars with
                   unprecedented precision and sensitivity. Key
                   processes in the ejection of matter and dust from
                   these objects occur in their inner zones. In this
                   work, we present sub-arcsecond interferometric maps
                   of transitions of metal-bearing molecules toward the
                   prototypical C-rich evolved star IRC +10216. While
                   Al-bearing molecules seem to be present as a roughly
                   spherical shell, the molecular emission from the
                   salts NaCl and KCl presents an elongation in the
                   inner regions with a central minimum. In order to
                   accurately analyze the emission from the NaCl
                   rotational lines, we present new calculations of the
                   collisional rates for this molecule based on new
                   spectroscopic constants. The most plausible
                   interpretation for the spatial distribution of the
                   salts is a spiral with a NaCl mass of 0.08 {M}&sun; .
                   Alternatively, a torus of gas and dust would result
                   in structures similar to those observed. From the
                   torus scenario we derive a mass of ˜1.1 × 10-4
                   {M}&sun; . In both cases, the spiral and the torus,
                   the NaCl structure presents an inner minimum of 27
                   AU. In the case of the torus, the outer radius is 73
                   AU. The kinematics of both the spiral and the torus
                   suggests that they are slowly expanding and rotating.
                   Alternative explanations for the presence of the
                   elongation are explored. The presence of these
                   features only in KCl and NaCl might be a result of

  abstract =      {Context. At the end of their lives, most stars lose a
                   significant amount of mass through a stellar wind.
                   The specific physical and chemical circumstances that
                   lead to the onset of the stellar wind for cool
                   luminous stars are not yet understood. Complex
                   geometrical morphologies in the circumstellar
                   envelopes prove that various dynamical and chemical
                   processes are interlocked and that their relative
                   contributions are not easy to disentangle. Aims: We
                   aim to study the inner-wind structure (R< 250 R*) of
                   the well-known red supergiant VY CMa, the archetype
                   for the class of luminous red supergiant stars
                   experiencing high mass loss. Specifically, the
                   objective is to unravel the density structure in the
                   inner envelope and to examine the chemical
                   interaction between gas and dust species. Methods: We
                   analyse high spatial resolution (~0.̋24×0.̋13)
                   ALMA science verification (SV) data in band 7, in
                   which four thermal emission lines of gaseous sodium
                   chloride (NaCl) are present at high signal-to-noise
                   ratio. Results: For the first time, the NaCl emission
                   in the inner wind region of VY CMa is spatially
                   resolved. The ALMA observations reveal the
                   contribution of up to four different spatial regions.
                   The NaCl emission pattern is different compared to
                   the dust continuum and TiO2 emission already analysed
                   from the ALMA SV data. The emission can be reconciled
                   with an axisymmetric geometry, where the lower
                   density polar/rotation axis has a position angle of
                   ~50$\,^{\circ}$ measured from north to east. However,
                   this picture cannot capture the full morphological
                   diversity, and discrete mass ejection events need to
                   be invoked to explain localized higher-density
                   regions. The velocity traced by the gaseous NaCl line
                   profiles is significantly lower than the average wind
                   terminal velocity, and much slower than some of the
                   fastest mass ejections, signalling a wide range of
                   characteristic speeds for the mass loss. Gaseous NaCl
                   is detected far beyond the main dust condensation
                   region. Realising the refractory nature of this metal
                   halide, this hints at a chemical process that
                   prevents all NaCl from condensing onto dust grains.
                   We show that in the case of the ratio of the surface
                   binding temperature to the grain temperature being
                   ~50, only some 10% of NaCl remains in gaseous form
                   while, for lower values of this ratio, thermal
                   desorption efficiently evaporates NaCl.
                   Photodesorption by stellar photons does not seem to
                   be a viable explanation for the detection of gaseous
                   NaCl at 220 R* from the central star, so instead, we
                   propose shock-induced sputtering driven by localized
                   mass ejection events as an alternative. Conclusions:
                   The analysis of the NaCl lines demonstrates the
                   capabilities of ALMA to decode the geometric
                   morphologies and chemical pathways prevailing in the
                   winds of evolved stars. These early ALMA results
                   prove that the envelopes surrounding evolved stars
                   are far from homogeneous, and that a variety of
                   dynamical and chemical processes dictate the wind
                   structure. The datacubes (FITS files) are only

                   superheated dust grains. This layer reemits directly
                   to space about half the stellar energy it absorbs.
                   The other half is emitted inward and regulates the
                   interior temperature of the disk. The heated disk
                   flares. As a consequence, it absorbs more stellar
                   radiation, especially at large radii, than a flat
                   disk would. The portion of the spectral energy
                   distribution contributed by the disk is fairly flat
                   throughout the thermal infrared. At fixed frequency,
                   the contribution from the surface layer exceeds that
                   from the interior by about a factor 3 and is emitted
                   at more than an order of magnitude greater radius.

                   stars like our Sun are currently being born. In this

                   including the newly discovered IR dark clouds that
                   are likely precursors to stellar clusters. At large

                   distributions with motions dominated by supersonic
                   turbulence. At small, subparsec scales, a population
                   of subsonic starless cores provides a unique glimpse

                   the 2.7 m telescope at the McDonald Observatory.
                   IGRINS has high spectral resolution (R˜ {{45,000}})
                   and instantaneous broad wavelength coverage
                   (1.45-2.45 mum), enabling us to detect 87 emission
                   lines from rovibrationally excited molecular hydrogen
                   (H2) that arise from transitions out of 69 upper
                   rovibration levels of the electronic ground state.
                   These levels cover a large range of rotational and
                   vibrational quantum numbers and excitation energies,
                   making them excellent probes of the excitation
                   mechanisms of H2 and physical conditions within the

                   cooler high density clumps or filaments (T=50{--}250
                   K, {n}H={10}5{--}{10}7 cm-3) embedded in a warmer
                   lower density medium (T=250{--}1000 K,
                   {n}H={10}4{--}{10}5 cm-3). We fit a grid of constant
                   temperature and density Cloudy models, which recreate
                   the observed H2 level populations well, to constrain
                   the temperature to a range of 600-650 K and the
                   density to {n}H=2.5× {10}3{--}{10}4 cm-3. The
                   best-fit model gives T = 625 K and {n}H=5× {10}3
                   cm-3. This well-constrained warm temperature is
                   consistent with kinetic temperatures found by other
                   studies for the Orion Bar's lower density medium.
                   However, the range of densities well fit by the model
                   grid is marginally lower than those reported by other
                   studies. We could be observing lower density gas than
                   the surrounding medium, or perhaps a
                   density-sensitive parameter in our models is not
                   properly estimated.},

                   and is scattered by dust towards our line of sight.
                   Aims: The reflected spectrum offers a unique
                   possibility of observing the emission from the
                   innermost regions of the system and probing the
                   nature of source I and its immediate surroundings.
                   Methods: We obtained moderately high
                   spectral-resolution (lambda/Deltalambda 9000)
                   observations of the near infrared diffuse emission in
                   several locations around source I/Orion-KL. We
                   observed a widespread rich absorption line spectrum
                   that we compare with cool stellar photospheres and
                   protostellar accretion disk models. Results: The
                   spectrum is broadly similar to strongly veiled, cool,
                   low-gravity stellar photospheres in the range Teff
                   3500-4500 K, luminosity class I-III. An exact match
                   explaining all features has not been found, and a
                   plausible explanation is that a range of different
                   temperatures contribute to the observed absorption
                   spectrum. The 1D velocity dispersions implied by the
                   absorption spectra, sigma 30 km s-1, can be explained
                   by the emission from a disk around a massive, m_* 10
                   M_&sun;, protostar that is accreting at a high rate,
                   dot{m_*} 3 × 10-3 M_&sun; yr-1. Conclusions: Our
                   observations suggest that the near-infrared
                   reflection spectrum observed in the Orion-KL region
                   is produced close to source I and scattered to our
                   line of sight in the OMC1 outflow cavity. The
                   spectrum allows us to exclude source I being a very
                   large, massive protostar rotating at breakup speed.
                   We suggest that the absorption spectrum is produced
                   in a disk surrounding a 10 M_&sun; protostar,
                   accreting from its disk at a high rate of a few ×
                   10-3 M_&sun;/yr). Based on observations collected at

  abstract =      {The Kleinmann--Low nebula in Orion, the closest
                   region of massive star formation, harbors Source I,
                   whose nature is under debate. Knowledge of this
                   source may have profound implications for our
                   understanding of the energetics of the hot core in
                   Orion KL since it might be the main heating source in
                   the region. The spectral energy distribution of this
                   source in the radio is characterized by a positive
                   spectral index close to 2, which is consistent with
                   (i) thermal bremsstrahlung emission of ionized
                   hydrogen gas produced by a central massive protostar,
                   or (ii) photospheric bremsstrahlung emission produced
                   by electrons when deflected by the interaction with
                   neutral and molecular hydrogen like Mira-like
                   variable stars. If ionized hydrogen gas were
                   responsible for the observed continuum emission, its
                   modeling would predict detectable emission from
                   hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRLs). However,
                   our SMA observations were obtained with a high enough
                   sensitivity to rule out that the radio continuum
                   emission arises from a dense hypercompact H II region
                   because the H26alpha line would have been detected,
                   in contrast with our observations. To explain the
                   observational constraints, we investigate further the
                   nature of the radio continuum emission from source I.
                   We have compared available radio continuum data with
                   the predictions from our upgraded non-LTE 3D
                   radiative transfer model, MOdel for REcombination
                   LInes, to show that radio continuum fluxes and sizes
                   can only be reproduced by assuming both dust and
                   bremsstrahlung emission from neutral gas. The dust
                   emission contribution is significant at nu >= 43 GHz.
                   In addition, our RRL peak intensity predictions for
                   the ionized metals case are consistent with the
                   nondetection of Na and K RRLs at millimeter and
                   submillimeter wavelengths.},

                   gravitational interactions with other stars may be
                   common. The two nearest forming massive stars, the BN
                   object and Source I, located behind the Orion Nebula,
                   were ejected with velocities of ˜29 and ˜13 km s-1
                   about 500 years ago by such interactions. This event
                   generated an explosion in the gas. New ALMA
                   observations show in unprecedented detail, a roughly
                   spherically symmetric distribution of over a hundred
                   12CO J = 2-1 streamers with velocities extending from
                   V LSR = -150 to +145 km s-1. The streamer radial
                   velocities increase (or decrease) linearly with
                   projected distance from the explosion center, forming
                   a ``Hubble Flow'' confined to within 50" of the
                   explosion center. They point toward the high
                   proper-motion, shock-excited H2 and [Fe ii]
                   ``fingertips'' and lower-velocity CO in the H2 wakes
                   comprising Orion's ``fingers.'' In some directions,
                   the H2 ``fingers'' extend more than a factor of two
                   farther from the ejection center than the CO
                   streamers. Such deviations from spherical symmetry
                   may be caused by ejecta running into dense gas or the
                   dynamics of the N-body interaction that ejected the
                   stars and produced the explosion. This ˜1048 erg
                   event may have been powered by the release of
                   gravitational potential energy associated with the
                   formation of a compact binary or a protostellar
                   merger. Orion may be the prototype for a new class of
                   stellar explosiozn responsible for luminous infrared
                   transients in nearby galaxies.},

                   Nebula Cluster with images obtained in 2015 with the
                   Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space
                   Telescope. By comparing those data to previous
                   measurements with the Near-Infrared Camera and
                   Multi-Object Spectrometer on Hubble in 1998, we have
                   discovered that a star in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula,
                   source x from Lonsdale et al., is moving with an
                   unusually high proper motion of 29 mas yr-1, which
                   corresponds to 55 km s-1 at the distance of Orion.
                   Previous radio observations have found that three
                   other stars in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula (the
                   Becklin-Neugebauer object and sources I and n) have
                   high proper motions (5-14 mas yr-1) and were near a
                   single location ˜540 years ago, and thus may have
                   been members of a multiple system that dynamically
                   decayed. The proper motion of source x is consistent
                   with ejection from that same location 540 years ago,
                   which provides strong evidence that the dynamical
                   decay did occur and that the runaway star BN
                   originated in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula rather than
                   the nearby Trapezium cluster. However, our constraint
                   on the motion of source n is significantly smaller
                   than the most recent radio measurement, which
                   indicates that it did not participate in the event
                   that ejected the other three stars. Based on
                   observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space

                   carbon star IRC+10216 and consider the effects of
                   periodic shocks induced by the stellar pulsation on
                   the gas to follow the non-equilibrium chemistry in
                   the shocked gas layers. We consider a very complete
                   set of chemical families, including hydrocarbons and
                   aromatics, hydrides, halogens, and
                   phosphorous-bearing species. Our derived abundances
                   are compared to those for the latest observational
                   data from large surveys and the Herschel telescope.
                   Methods: A semi-analytical formalism based on
                   parameterised fluid equations is used to describe the
                   gas density, velocity, and temperature from 1 R* to 5
                   R*. The chemistry is described using a chemical
                   kinetic network of reactions and a set of stiff,
                   ordinary, coupled differential equations is solved.
                   Results: The shocks induce an active non-equilibrium
                   chemistry in the dust formation zone of IRC+10216
                   where the collision destruction of CO in the
                   post-shock gas triggers the formation of O-bearing
                   species such as H2O and SiO. Most of the modelled
                   molecular abundances agree very well with the latest
                   values derived from Herschel data on IRC+10216. The
                   hydrides form a family of abundant species that are
                   expelled into the intermediate envelope. In
                   particular, HF traps all the atomic fluorine in the
                   dust formation zone. The halogens are also abundant
                   and their chemistry is independent of the C/O ratio
                   of the star. Therefore, HCl and other Cl-bearing
                   species should also be present in the inner wind of
                   O-rich AGB or supergiant stars. We identify a
                   specific region ranging from 2.5 R* to 4 R*, where
                   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form and grow. The
                   estimated carbon dust-to-gas mass ratio derived from
                   the mass of aromatics formed ranges from 1.2 × 10-3
                   to 5.8 × 10-3 and agrees well with existing values
                   deduced from observations. This aromatic formation
                   region is situated outside hot layers where SiC2 is
                   produced as a bi-product of silicon carbide dust
                   synthesis. The MgS grains can form from the gas phase
                   but in lower quantities than those necessary to
                   reproduce the strength of the 30 mum emission band.
                   Finally, we predict that some molecular lines will
                   show a flux variation with pulsation phase and time
                   (e.g., H2O), while other species will not (e.g., CO).
                   These variations merely reflect the non-equilibrium
                   chemistry that destroys and reforms molecules over a

                   line emission constitutes 22% of the total detected

                   molecules are the main contributors. Toward M, 14% of
                   the broadband flux is caused by lines, and SO2 is
                   here the dominant source of emission. NW is

                   to Earth suggest that the interstellar chemistry is
                   capable of producing such complex organic molecules.
                   Our goal is to investigate the degree of chemical
                   complexity that can be reached in the ISM. We
                   performed an unbiased, spectral line survey toward
                   Sgr B2(N) and (M) with the IRAM 30m telescope in the
                   3mm window. The spectra were analyzed with a simple
                   radiative transfer model that assumes LTE but takes
                   optical depth effects into account. About 3675 and
                   945 spectral lines with a peak signal-to-noise ratio
                   higher than 4 are detected toward N and M, i.e. about
                   102 and 26 lines per GHz, respectively. This
                   represents an increase by about a factor of 2 over
                   previous surveys of Sgr B2. About 70% and 47% of the
                   lines detected toward N and M are identified and
                   assigned to 56 and 46 distinct molecules as well as
                   to 66 and 54 less abundant isotopologues of these
                   molecules, respectively. We also report the detection
                   of transitions from 59 and 24 catalog entries
                   corresponding to vibrationally or torsionally excited
                   states of some of these molecules, respectively.
                   Excitation temperatures and column densities were
                   derived for each species but should be used with
                   caution. Among the detected molecules,
                   aminoacetonitrile, n-propyl cyanide, and ethyl
                   formate were reported for the first time in space
                   based on this survey, as were 5 rare isotopologues of
                   vinyl cyanide, cyanoacetylene, and hydrogen cyanide.
                   We also report the detection of transitions from
                   within 12 new vib. or tors. excited states of known
                   molecules. Although the large number of unidentified
                   lines may still allow future identification of new
                   molecules, we expect most of these lines to belong to
                   vib. or tors. excited states or to rare isotopologues
                   of known molecules for which spectroscopic
                   predictions are currently missing. (abridged)},

                   observations carried out with the Submillimeter Array
                   (SMA) at 880 mum centered at the B0-type protostar
                   GGD27 MM1, the driving source of the parsec scale HH
                   80-81 jet. We constrain its polarized continuum
                   emission to ≲0.8% at this wavelength. Its
                   submillimeter spectrum is dominated by sulfur-bearing
                   species tracing a rotating-disk-like structure (SO
                   and SO2 isotopologues mainly), but also shows
                   HCN-bearing and CH3OH lines, which trace the disk and
                   the outflow cavity walls excavated by the HH 80-81
                   jet. The presence of many sulfurated lines could
                   indicate the presence of shocked gas at the disk's
                   centrifugal barrier or that MM1 is a hot core at an
                   evolved stage. The resolved SO2 emission traces the
                   disk kinematics very well and we fit the SMA
                   observations using a thin-disk Keplerian model, which
                   gives the inclination (47$\,^{\circ}$), the inner
                   (≲170 au) and outer (˜950-1300 au) radii, and the
                   disk's rotation velocity (3.4 km s-1 at a putative
                   radius of 1700 au). We roughly estimate a
                   protostellar dynamical mass of 4-18 {M}&sun; . MM2
                   and WMC cores show, comparatively, an almost empty
                   spectra, suggesting that they are associated with
                   extended emission detected in previous low-angular
                   resolution observations, and therefore indicating
                   youth (MM2) or the presence of a less massive object

                   broadband spectroscopy is coming to press. As part of
                   this verification process it is useful to compare
                   simulations based on laboratory spectroscopy with
                   ALMA results. This provides not only a test of
                   instrumentation and analysis, but also a test of
                   astrophysical assumptions such as local thermodynamic
                   equilibrium (LTE) and the temperature variations
                   within telescope beams. However, these tests are
                   spectroscopically limited because it is well known
                   that astrophysical spectra contain large numbers of
                   unknown lines, many of which are presumably due to
                   unanalyzed rotational spectra in excited vibrational
                   states of a relatively few molecules. To address this
                   issue we have previously discussed the use of
                   broadband complete experimental spectra (CES) that is
                   obtained from the analysis of several hundred
                   intensity calibrated spectra taken over a range of
                   temperatures. In this paper we will compare these CES
                   with the similarly complete astrophysical spectra.},
