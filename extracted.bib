                   Array (ALMA) observations of a circumstellar disk
                   around Source I in Orion KL, an archetype of massive
                   protostar candidates. We detected two ortho-H2O lines
                   at 321 GHz (102, 9-93, 6) and 336 GHz (nu2 = 1, 52,
                   3-61, 6) for the first time in Source I. The latter
                   one is in a vibrationally excited state at the lower
                   state energy of 2939 K, suggesting evidence of hot
                   molecular gas close to Source I. The integrated
                   intensity map of the 321 GHz line is elongated along
                   the bipolar outflow while the 336 GHz line map is
                   unresolved with a beam size of 0.''4. Both of these
                   maps show velocity gradients perpendicular to the
                   bipolar outflow. The velocity centroid map of the 321
                   GHz line implies a spatial and velocity structure
                   similar to that of vibrationally excited SiO masers
                   tracing the root of the outflow emanating from the
                   disk surface. In contrast, the 336 GHz line is most
                   likely emitting from the disk midplane with a
                   diameter of 0.''2 (84 AU) as traced by radio
                   continuum emission and a dark lane devoid of the
                   vibrationally excited SiO maser emission. The
                   observed velocity gradient and the spectral profile
                   of the 336 GHz H2O line can be reconciled with a
                   model of an edge-on ring-like structure with an
                   enclosed mass of >7 M &sun; and an excitation
                   temperature of >3000 K. The present results provide
                   further evidence of a hot and neutral circumstellar
                   disk rotating around Source I with a diameter of ~100
                   AU scale.},

  abstract =      {Orion Source I (``SrcI'') is the protostar at the
                   center of the Kleinmann-Low Nebula. ALMA observations
                   of SrcI with 0."2 angular resolution were made at 350
                   and 660 GHz to search for the H26alpha and H21alpha
                   hydrogen recombination lines and to measure the
                   continuum flux densities. The recombination lines
                   were not detected, ruling out the possibility that
                   SrcI is a hypercompact H II region. The deconvolved
                   size of the continuum source is approximately 0."23
                   × 0."07 (˜100 × 30 au); it is interpreted as a
                   disk viewed almost edge-on. Optically thick thermal
                   emission from ˜500 K dust is the most plausible
                   source of the continuum, even at frequencies as low
                   as 43 GHz; the disk mass is most likely in the range
                   0.02-0.2 {M}&sun; . A rich spectrum of molecular
                   lines is detected, mostly from sulfur- and
                   silicon-rich molecules like SO, SO2, and SiS, but
                   also including vibrationally excited CO and several
                   unidentified transitions. Lines with upper energy
                   levels {E}{{U}}\gt 500 K appear in emission and are
                   symmetric about the source's LSR velocity of 5 {km}
                   {{{s}}}-1, while lines with {E}{{U}}\lt 500 K appear
                   as blueshifted absorption features against the
                   continuum, indicating that they originate in
                   outflowing gas. The emission lines exhibit a velocity
                   gradient along the major axis of the disk that is
                   consistent with rotation around a 5-7 {M}&sun;

                   the existence of a 100 au disk around it are
                   difficult to reconcile with the model in which SrcI
                   and the nearby Becklin-Neugebauer Object were ejected
                   from a multiple system 500 years ago.},

                   continuum and spectral line emission from SrcI's
                   disk. We also detect a central weakly resolved source
                   that we interpret as a hot spot in the inner disk,
                   which may indicate the presence of a binary system.
                   The high angular resolution and sensitivity of these
                   observations allows us to measure the outer envelope
                   of the rotation curve of the H2O 55,0--64,3 line,
                   which gives a mass M I ≈ 15 $\pm$ 2 {M}o . We
                   detected several other lines that more closely trace
                   the disk, but were unable to identify their parent
                   species. Using centroid-of-channel methods on these

                   protostar system and support the theory that SrcI and

                   dynamical decay of a multiple-star system ~500 years

                   BN/KL from 42.3 to 43.6 GHz with the Green Bank
                   Telescope. Sixty-seven lines were identified and
                   ascribed to 13 different molecular species. The
                   spectrum at 7 mm is dominated by SiO, SO2, CH3OCH3,
                   and C2H5CN. Five transitions have been detected from
                   the SiO isotopologues 28SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO. We
                   report here for the first time the spectra of the

                   with velocity extents similar to the main
                   isotopologue. The main motivation for the survey was
                   the search of high-velocity (100-1000 km s-1)
                   outflows in the BN/KL region as traced by SiO Doppler

                   without imaging data their location cannot be
                   established. Wings of emission are present in the v =
                   0 28SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO profiles, and we suggest
                   that the v = 0 emission from the three isotopologues
                   might trace a moderately high-velocity (~30-50 km
                   s-1) component of the flows around the high-mass
                   protostar Source I in the Orion BN/KL region. We also
                   confirm the 7 mm detection of a complex
                   oxygen-bearing species, acetone (CH3COCH3), which has
                   been recently observed toward the hot core at 3 mm,

                   observational constraints on disk-mediated accretion
                   in this context have been scarce, largely owing to
                   difficulties in probing the circumstellar gas at

                   nearest example of a high-mass YSO, and only one of

                   overcome past observational limitations by mapping

                   evolution of the circumstellar gas within 1000 AU
                   from Source I. Based on 19 epochs of VLBA
                   observations of v=1,2 SiO masers over ~2 years, we
                   produced a movie of bulk gas flow tracing the compact
                   disk and the base of the protostellar wind at radii <
                   100 AU from Source I. In addition, we have used the
                   VLA to map 7mm SiO v=0 emission and track proper
                   motions over 10 years. We identify a narrowly
                   collimated outflow with a mean motion of 18 km/s at
                   radii 100-1000 AU, along a NE-SW axis perpendicular
                   to that of the disk traced by the v=1,2 masers. The
                   VLBA and VLA data exclude alternate models that place

                   stars. Five rotational transitions of NaCl at 1 and 2
                   mm were detected toward VY CMa and three 1 mm lines
                   were observed toward IK Tau, using the telescopes of
                   the Arizona Radio Observatory. In both objects, the
                   line widths of the NaCl profiles were extremely
                   narrow relative to those of other molecules,
                   indicating that sodium chloride has not reached the
                   terminal outflow velocity in either star, likely a
                   result of early condensation onto grains. Modeling
                   the observed spectra suggests abundances, relative to
                   H2, of f~5×10-9 in VY CMa and f~4×10-9 in IK Tau,
                   with source sizes of 0.5" and 0.3", respectively. The
                   extent of these sources is consistent with the size
                   of the dust acceleration zones in both stars. NaCl
                   therefore appears to be at least as abundant in
                   O-rich shells as compared to C-rich envelopes, where
                   f~(0.2-2)×10-9, although it appears to condense out
                   earlier in the O-rich case. Chemical equilibrium
                   calculations indicate that NaCl is the major carrier
                   of sodium at T~1100 K for oxygen-rich stars, with
                   predicted fractional abundances in good agreement
                   with the observations. These measurements suggest
                   that crystalline salt may be an important condensate
                   for sodium in both C- and O-rich circumstellar
                   shells.},

                   30 m telescope, the first time this molecule has been
                   identified in a source other than IRC +10216. The
                   J=7-->6, 11-->10, 12-->11, and 18-->17 transitions of
                   NaCl at 1, 2, and 3 mm have been observed, as well as
                   the J=8-->7 line of the 37Cl isotopomer. The
                   J=12-->11 line was also measured at the ARO 12 m
                   telescope. An unsuccessful search was additionally
                   conducted for AlCl toward CRL 2688, although in the
                   process new transitions of NaCN were observed. Both
                   NaCl and NaCN were found to be present in the AGB
                   remnant wind, as suggested by their U-shaped line
                   profiles, indicative of emission arising from an
                   optically thin, extended shell-like source of radius
                   ~10"-12". These data contrast with past results in
                   IRC +10216, where the distribution of both molecules
                   is confined to within a few arcseconds of the star. A
                   high degree of excitation is required for the
                   transitions observed for NaCl and NaCN; therefore,
                   these two species likely arise in the region where
                   the high-velocity outflow has collided with the
                   remnant wind. Here the effects of shocks and clumping
                   due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities have raised the
                   densities and temperatures significantly. The shell
                   source is thus likely to be clumpy and irregular. The
                   chemistry producing the sodium compounds is
                   consequently more complex than simple LTE formation.
                   Abundances of NaCl and NaCN, relative to H2, are
                   f~1.6×10-10 and ~5.2×10-9, respectively, while the
                   upper limit to AlCl is f<2×10-9. These values differ
                   substantially from those in IRC +10216, where AlCl
                   has an abundance near 10-7. The NaCl observations
                   additionally indicate a chlorine isotope ratio of
                   35Cl/37Cl=2.1+/-0.8 in CRL 2688, suggestive of
                   s-process enhancement of chlorine 37.},

  abstract =      {We present continuum and molecular line emission ALMA
                   observations of OH 231.8+4.2, a well studied bipolar
                   nebula around an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star.
                   The high angular resolution (~0.2-0.3 arcsec) and
                   sensitivity of our ALMA maps provide the most
                   detailed and accurate description of the overall
                   nebular structure and kinematics of this object to
                   date. We have identified a number of outflow
                   components previously unknown. Species studied in
                   this work include 12CO, 13CO, CS, SO, SO2, OCS, SiO,
                   SiS, H3O+, Na37Cl, and CH3OH. The molecules Na37Cl
                   and CH3OH are first detections in OH 231.8+4.2, with
                   CH3OH being also a first detection in an AGB star.
                   Our ALMA maps bring to light the totally unexpected
                   position of the mass-losing AGB star (QX Pup)
                   relative to the large-scale outflow. QX Pup is
                   enshrouded within a compact (<60 AU) parcel of dust
                   and gas (clump S) in expansion (V~5-7 km/s) that is
                   displaced by 0.6arcsec to the south of the dense
                   equatorial region (or waist) where the bipolar lobes
                   join. Our SiO maps disclose a compact bipolar outflow
                   that emerges from QX Pup's vicinity. This outflow is
                   oriented similarly to the large-scale nebula but the
                   expansion velocities are about ten times lower (~35
                   km/s). We deduce short kinematical ages for the SiO
                   outflow, ranging from ~50-80 yr, in regions within
                   ~150 AU, to ~400-500 yr at the lobe tips (~3500 AU).
                   Adjacent to the SiO outflow, we identify a
                   small-scale hourglass-shaped structure
                   (mini-hourglass) that is probably made of compressed
                   ambient material formed as the SiO outflow penetrates
                   the dense, central regions of the nebula. The lobes
                   and the equatorial waist of the mini-hourglass are
                   both radially expanding with a constant velocity
                   gradient. The mini-waist is characterized by
                   extremely low velocities, down to ~1 km/s at ~150 AU,
                   which tentatively suggest the presence of a stable
                   structure. (abridged)},

                   established Hamiltonian models to ensure entries that

                   More than 300 entries are available as of April 2005.
                   Examples of recently included light hydride species,

                   species detected in space but also for compounds that
                   may be detected in the future. Therefore, the catalog
                   is an ideal tool for analyzing line surveys and for
                   searching for new molecules in space. In addition,

  abstract =      {Context. The inner layers of circumstellar envelopes
                   around asymptotic giant branch stars are sites where
                   a variety of processes such as thermochemical
                   equilibrium, shocks induced by the stellar pulsation,
                   and condensation of dust grains determine the
                   chemical composition of the material that is expelled
                   into the outer envelope layers and, ultimately, into
                   interstellar space. Aims: We aim at studying the
                   abundances, throughout the whole circumstellar
                   envelope of the carbon star IRC +10216, of several
                   molecules formed in the inner layers in order to
                   constrain the different processes at work in such
                   regions. Methods: Observations towards IRC +10216 of
                   CS, SiO, SiS, NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN have
                   been carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope in the
                   80-357.5 GHz frequency range. A large number of
                   rotational transitions covering a wide range of
                   energy levels, including highly excited vibrational
                   states, are detected in emission and serve to trace
                   different regions of the envelope. Radiative transfer
                   calculations based on the LVG formalism have been
                   performed to derive molecular abundances from the
                   innermost out to the outer layers. The excitation
                   calculations include infrared pumping to excited
                   vibrational states and inelastic collisions, for
                   which up-to-date rate coefficients for rotational
                   and, in some cases, ro-vibrational transitions are
                   used. Results: We find that in the inner layers CS,
                   SiO, and SiS have abundances relative to H2 of 4 ×
                   10-6, 1.8 × 10-7, and 3 × 10-6, respectively, and
                   that CS and SiS have significant lower abundances in
                   the outer envelope, which implies that they actively
                   contribute to the formation of dust. Moreover, in the
                   inner layers, the amount of sulfur and silicon in gas
                   phase molecules is only 27% for S and 5.6% for Si,
                   implying that these elements have already condensed
                   onto grains, most likely in the form of MgS and SiC.
                   Metal-bearing molecules lock up a relatively small
                   fraction of metals, although our results indicate
                   that NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN, despite their
                   refractory character, are not significantly depleted
                   in the cold outer layers. In these regions a few
                   percent of the metals Na, K, and Al survive in the
                   gas phase, either in atomic or molecular form, and
                   are therefore available to participate in the gas
                   phase chemistry in the outer envelope. Based on

                   circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars with
                   unprecedented precision and sensitivity. Key
                   processes in the ejection of matter and dust from
                   these objects occur in their inner zones. In this
                   work, we present sub-arcsecond interferometric maps
                   of transitions of metal-bearing molecules toward the
                   prototypical C-rich evolved star IRC +10216. While
                   Al-bearing molecules seem to be present as a roughly
                   spherical shell, the molecular emission from the
                   salts NaCl and KCl presents an elongation in the
                   inner regions with a central minimum. In order to
                   accurately analyze the emission from the NaCl
                   rotational lines, we present new calculations of the
                   collisional rates for this molecule based on new
                   spectroscopic constants. The most plausible
                   interpretation for the spatial distribution of the
                   salts is a spiral with a NaCl mass of 0.08 {M}&sun; .
                   Alternatively, a torus of gas and dust would result
                   in structures similar to those observed. From the
                   torus scenario we derive a mass of ˜1.1 × 10-4
                   {M}&sun; . In both cases, the spiral and the torus,
                   the NaCl structure presents an inner minimum of 27
                   AU. In the case of the torus, the outer radius is 73
                   AU. The kinematics of both the spiral and the torus
                   suggests that they are slowly expanding and rotating.
                   Alternative explanations for the presence of the
                   elongation are explored. The presence of these
                   features only in KCl and NaCl might be a result of
                   their comparatively high dipole moment with respect
                   to the Al-bearing species.},

                   Immersion Grating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on
                   the 2.7 m telescope at the McDonald Observatory.
                   IGRINS has high spectral resolution (R˜ {{45,000}})
                   and instantaneous broad wavelength coverage
                   (1.45-2.45 mum), enabling us to detect 87 emission
                   lines from rovibrationally excited molecular hydrogen
                   (H2) that arise from transitions out of 69 upper
                   rovibration levels of the electronic ground state.
                   These levels cover a large range of rotational and
                   vibrational quantum numbers and excitation energies,
                   making them excellent probes of the excitation
                   mechanisms of H2 and physical conditions within the
                   PDR. The Orion Bar PDR is thought to consist of
                   cooler high density clumps or filaments (T=50{--}250
                   K, {n}H={10}5{--}{10}7 cm-3) embedded in a warmer
                   lower density medium (T=250{--}1000 K,
                   {n}H={10}4{--}{10}5 cm-3). We fit a grid of constant
                   temperature and density Cloudy models, which recreate
                   the observed H2 level populations well, to constrain
                   the temperature to a range of 600-650 K and the
                   density to {n}H=2.5× {10}3{--}{10}4 cm-3. The
                   best-fit model gives T = 625 K and {n}H=5× {10}3
                   cm-3. This well-constrained warm temperature is
                   consistent with kinetic temperatures found by other
                   studies for the Orion Bar's lower density medium.
                   However, the range of densities well fit by the model
                   grid is marginally lower than those reported by other
                   studies. We could be observing lower density gas than
                   the surrounding medium, or perhaps a
                   density-sensitive parameter in our models is not
                   properly estimated.},

                   resolution with CARMA, allowing measurements of the
                   flux densities of Source I ("SrcI") and the
                   Becklin-Neugebauer Object (BN), the two most massive
                   stars in this region. We find integrated flux
                   densities of 310 $\pm$ 45 mJy for SrcI and 240 $\pm$
                   35 mJy for BN. SrcI is optically thick even at 229
                   GHz. No trace of the H30alpha recombination line is
                   seen in its spectrum, although the v 2 = 1,
                   5(5,0)-6(4,3) transition of H2O, 3450 K above the
                   ground state, is prominent. SrcI is elongated at
                   position angle 140$\,^{\circ}$, as in 43 GHz images.
                   These results are most easily reconciled with models
                   in which the radio emission from SrcI arises via the
                   H- free-free opacity in a T < 4500 K disk, as
                   considered by Reid et al. By contrast, the radio
                   spectrum of BN is consistent with p +/e - free-free
                   emission from a dense (ne ~ 5 × 107 cm-3), but
                   otherwise conventional, hypercompact H II region. The
                   source is becoming optically thin at 229 GHz, and the
                   H30alpha recombination line, at V LSR = 23.2 $\pm$
                   0.5 km s-1, is prominent in its spectrum. A Lyman
                   continuum flux of 5 × 1045 photons s-1, consistent
                   with that expected from a B star, is required to
                   maintain the ionization. Supplementary 90 GHz
                   observations were made to measure the H41alpha and
                   H42alpha recombination lines toward BN. Published 43
                   and 86 GHz data suggest that SrcI brightened with
                   respect to BN over the 15 year period from 1994 to
                   2009.},

  abstract =      {Aims: We model the chemistry of the inner wind of the
                   carbon star IRC+10216 and consider the effects of
                   periodic shocks induced by the stellar pulsation on
                   the gas to follow the non-equilibrium chemistry in
                   the shocked gas layers. We consider a very complete
                   set of chemical families, including hydrocarbons and
                   aromatics, hydrides, halogens, and
                   phosphorous-bearing species. Our derived abundances
                   are compared to those for the latest observational
                   data from large surveys and the Herschel telescope.
                   Methods: A semi-analytical formalism based on
                   parameterised fluid equations is used to describe the
                   gas density, velocity, and temperature from 1 R* to 5
                   R*. The chemistry is described using a chemical
                   kinetic network of reactions and a set of stiff,
                   ordinary, coupled differential equations is solved.
                   Results: The shocks induce an active non-equilibrium
                   chemistry in the dust formation zone of IRC+10216
                   where the collision destruction of CO in the
                   post-shock gas triggers the formation of O-bearing
                   species such as H2O and SiO. Most of the modelled
                   molecular abundances agree very well with the latest
                   values derived from Herschel data on IRC+10216. The
                   hydrides form a family of abundant species that are
                   expelled into the intermediate envelope. In
                   particular, HF traps all the atomic fluorine in the
                   dust formation zone. The halogens are also abundant
                   and their chemistry is independent of the C/O ratio
                   of the star. Therefore, HCl and other Cl-bearing
                   species should also be present in the inner wind of
                   O-rich AGB or supergiant stars. We identify a
                   specific region ranging from 2.5 R* to 4 R*, where
                   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form and grow. The
                   estimated carbon dust-to-gas mass ratio derived from
                   the mass of aromatics formed ranges from 1.2 × 10-3
                   to 5.8 × 10-3 and agrees well with existing values
                   deduced from observations. This aromatic formation
                   region is situated outside hot layers where SiC2 is
                   produced as a bi-product of silicon carbide dust
                   synthesis. The MgS grains can form from the gas phase
                   but in lower quantities than those necessary to
                   reproduce the strength of the 30 mum emission band.
                   Finally, we predict that some molecular lines will
                   show a flux variation with pulsation phase and time
                   (e.g., H2O), while other species will not (e.g., CO).
                   These variations merely reflect the non-equilibrium
                   chemistry that destroys and reforms molecules over a
                   pulsation period in the shocked gas of the dust
                   formation zone. Full Table A.1 is only available at

                   gravitational interactions with other stars may be
                   common. The two nearest forming massive stars, the BN
                   object and Source I, located behind the Orion Nebula,
                   were ejected with velocities of ˜29 and ˜13 km s-1
                   about 500 years ago by such interactions. This event
                   generated an explosion in the gas. New ALMA
                   observations show in unprecedented detail, a roughly
                   spherically symmetric distribution of over a hundred
                   12CO J = 2-1 streamers with velocities extending from
                   V LSR = -150 to +145 km s-1. The streamer radial
                   velocities increase (or decrease) linearly with
                   projected distance from the explosion center, forming
                   a ``Hubble Flow'' confined to within 50" of the
                   explosion center. They point toward the high
                   proper-motion, shock-excited H2 and [Fe ii]
                   ``fingertips'' and lower-velocity CO in the H2 wakes
                   comprising Orion's ``fingers.'' In some directions,
                   the H2 ``fingers'' extend more than a factor of two
                   farther from the ejection center than the CO
                   streamers. Such deviations from spherical symmetry
                   may be caused by ejecta running into dense gas or the
                   dynamics of the N-body interaction that ejected the
                   stars and produced the explosion. This ˜1048 erg
                   event may have been powered by the release of
                   gravitational potential energy associated with the
                   formation of a compact binary or a protostellar
                   merger. Orion may be the prototype for a new class of
                   stellar explosiozn responsible for luminous infrared

                   Nebula Cluster with images obtained in 2015 with the
                   Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space
                   Telescope. By comparing those data to previous
                   measurements with the Near-Infrared Camera and
                   Multi-Object Spectrometer on Hubble in 1998, we have
                   discovered that a star in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula,
                   source x from Lonsdale et al., is moving with an
                   unusually high proper motion of 29 mas yr-1, which
                   corresponds to 55 km s-1 at the distance of Orion.
                   Previous radio observations have found that three
                   other stars in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula (the
                   Becklin-Neugebauer object and sources I and n) have
                   high proper motions (5-14 mas yr-1) and were near a
                   single location ˜540 years ago, and thus may have
                   been members of a multiple system that dynamically
                   decayed. The proper motion of source x is consistent
                   with ejection from that same location 540 years ago,
                   which provides strong evidence that the dynamical
                   decay did occur and that the runaway star BN
                   originated in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula rather than
                   the nearby Trapezium cluster. However, our constraint
                   on the motion of source n is significantly smaller
                   than the most recent radio measurement, which
                   indicates that it did not participate in the event
                   that ejected the other three stars. Based on

                   (J2000)) are available as this special issue on
                   broadband spectroscopy is coming to press. As part of
                   this verification process it is useful to compare
                   simulations based on laboratory spectroscopy with
                   ALMA results. This provides not only a test of
                   instrumentation and analysis, but also a test of
                   astrophysical assumptions such as local thermodynamic
                   equilibrium (LTE) and the temperature variations
                   within telescope beams. However, these tests are
                   spectroscopically limited because it is well known
                   that astrophysical spectra contain large numbers of
                   unknown lines, many of which are presumably due to
                   unanalyzed rotational spectra in excited vibrational
                   states of a relatively few molecules. To address this
                   issue we have previously discussed the use of
                   broadband complete experimental spectra (CES) that is
                   obtained from the analysis of several hundred
                   intensity calibrated spectra taken over a range of
                   temperatures. In this paper we will compare these CES
                   with the similarly complete astrophysical spectra.},

                   transformations, world coordinate system (WCS)
                   support, generalized containers for representing
                   gridded as well as tabular data, and a framework for
                   cosmological transformations and conversions.
                   Significant functionality is under activedevelopment,
                   such as a model fitting framework, VO client and
                   server tools, and aperture and point spread function
                   (PSF) photometry tools. The core development team is
