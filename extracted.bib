                   Array (ALMA) observations of a circumstellar disk
                   around Source I in Orion KL, an archetype of massive
                   protostar candidates. We detected two ortho-H2O lines
                   at 321 GHz (102, 9-93, 6) and 336 GHz (nu2 = 1, 52,
                   3-61, 6) for the first time in Source I. The latter
                   one is in a vibrationally excited state at the lower
                   state energy of 2939 K, suggesting evidence of hot
                   molecular gas close to Source I. The integrated
                   intensity map of the 321 GHz line is elongated along
                   the bipolar outflow while the 336 GHz line map is
                   unresolved with a beam size of 0.''4. Both of these
                   maps show velocity gradients perpendicular to the
                   bipolar outflow. The velocity centroid map of the 321
                   GHz line implies a spatial and velocity structure
                   similar to that of vibrationally excited SiO masers
                   tracing the root of the outflow emanating from the
                   disk surface. In contrast, the 336 GHz line is most
                   likely emitting from the disk midplane with a
                   diameter of 0.''2 (84 AU) as traced by radio
                   continuum emission and a dark lane devoid of the
                   vibrationally excited SiO maser emission. The
                   observed velocity gradient and the spectral profile
                   of the 336 GHz H2O line can be reconciled with a
                   model of an edge-on ring-like structure with an
                   enclosed mass of >7 M &sun; and an excitation
                   temperature of >3000 K. The present results provide
                   further evidence of a hot and neutral circumstellar
                   disk rotating around Source I with a diameter of ~100
                   AU scale.},

  abstract =      {Orion Source I (``SrcI'') is the protostar at the
                   center of the Kleinmann-Low Nebula. ALMA observations
                   of SrcI with 0."2 angular resolution were made at 350
                   and 660 GHz to search for the H26alpha and H21alpha
                   hydrogen recombination lines and to measure the
                   continuum flux densities. The recombination lines
                   were not detected, ruling out the possibility that
                   SrcI is a hypercompact H II region. The deconvolved
                   size of the continuum source is approximately 0."23
                   × 0."07 (˜100 × 30 au); it is interpreted as a
                   disk viewed almost edge-on. Optically thick thermal
                   emission from ˜500 K dust is the most plausible
                   source of the continuum, even at frequencies as low
                   as 43 GHz; the disk mass is most likely in the range
                   0.02-0.2 {M}&sun; . A rich spectrum of molecular
                   lines is detected, mostly from sulfur- and
                   silicon-rich molecules like SO, SO2, and SiS, but
                   also including vibrationally excited CO and several
                   unidentified transitions. Lines with upper energy
                   levels {E}{{U}}\gt 500 K appear in emission and are
                   symmetric about the source's LSR velocity of 5 {km}
                   {{{s}}}-1, while lines with {E}{{U}}\lt 500 K appear
                   as blueshifted absorption features against the
                   continuum, indicating that they originate in
                   outflowing gas. The emission lines exhibit a velocity
                   gradient along the major axis of the disk that is
                   consistent with rotation around a 5-7 {M}&sun;

                   the existence of a 100 au disk around it are
                   difficult to reconcile with the model in which SrcI
                   and the nearby Becklin-Neugebauer Object were ejected
                   from a multiple system 500 years ago.},

                   continuum and spectral line emission from SrcI's
                   disk. We also detect a central weakly resolved source
                   that we interpret as a hot spot in the inner disk,
                   which may indicate the presence of a binary system.
                   The high angular resolution and sensitivity of these
                   observations allows us to measure the outer envelope
                   of the rotation curve of the H2O 55,0--64,3 line,
                   which gives a mass M I ≈ 15 $\pm$ 2 {M}o . We
                   detected several other lines that more closely trace
                   the disk, but were unable to identify their parent
                   species. Using centroid-of-channel methods on these

                   protostar system and support the theory that SrcI and

                   dynamical decay of a multiple-star system ~500 years

                   BN/KL from 42.3 to 43.6 GHz with the Green Bank
                   Telescope. Sixty-seven lines were identified and
                   ascribed to 13 different molecular species. The
                   spectrum at 7 mm is dominated by SiO, SO2, CH3OCH3,
                   and C2H5CN. Five transitions have been detected from
                   the SiO isotopologues 28SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO. We
                   report here for the first time the spectra of the

                   with velocity extents similar to the main
                   isotopologue. The main motivation for the survey was
                   the search of high-velocity (100-1000 km s-1)
                   outflows in the BN/KL region as traced by SiO Doppler

                   without imaging data their location cannot be
                   established. Wings of emission are present in the v =
                   0 28SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO profiles, and we suggest
                   that the v = 0 emission from the three isotopologues
                   might trace a moderately high-velocity (~30-50 km
                   s-1) component of the flows around the high-mass
                   protostar Source I in the Orion BN/KL region. We also
                   confirm the 7 mm detection of a complex
                   oxygen-bearing species, acetone (CH3COCH3), which has
                   been recently observed toward the hot core at 3 mm,

                   observational constraints on disk-mediated accretion
                   in this context have been scarce, largely owing to
                   difficulties in probing the circumstellar gas at

                   nearest example of a high-mass YSO, and only one of

                   overcome past observational limitations by mapping

                   evolution of the circumstellar gas within 1000 AU
                   from Source I. Based on 19 epochs of VLBA
                   observations of v=1,2 SiO masers over ~2 years, we
                   produced a movie of bulk gas flow tracing the compact
                   disk and the base of the protostellar wind at radii <
                   100 AU from Source I. In addition, we have used the
                   VLA to map 7mm SiO v=0 emission and track proper
                   motions over 10 years. We identify a narrowly
                   collimated outflow with a mean motion of 18 km/s at
                   radii 100-1000 AU, along a NE-SW axis perpendicular
                   to that of the disk traced by the v=1,2 masers. The
                   VLBA and VLA data exclude alternate models that place

                   stars. Five rotational transitions of NaCl at 1 and 2
                   mm were detected toward VY CMa and three 1 mm lines
                   were observed toward IK Tau, using the telescopes of
                   the Arizona Radio Observatory. In both objects, the
                   line widths of the NaCl profiles were extremely
                   narrow relative to those of other molecules,
                   indicating that sodium chloride has not reached the
                   terminal outflow velocity in either star, likely a
                   result of early condensation onto grains. Modeling
                   the observed spectra suggests abundances, relative to
                   H2, of f~5×10-9 in VY CMa and f~4×10-9 in IK Tau,
                   with source sizes of 0.5" and 0.3", respectively. The
                   extent of these sources is consistent with the size
                   of the dust acceleration zones in both stars. NaCl
                   therefore appears to be at least as abundant in
                   O-rich shells as compared to C-rich envelopes, where
                   f~(0.2-2)×10-9, although it appears to condense out
                   earlier in the O-rich case. Chemical equilibrium
                   calculations indicate that NaCl is the major carrier
                   of sodium at T~1100 K for oxygen-rich stars, with
                   predicted fractional abundances in good agreement
                   with the observations. These measurements suggest
                   that crystalline salt may be an important condensate
                   for sodium in both C- and O-rich circumstellar
                   shells.},

                   identified in a source other than IRC +10216. The
                   J=7-->6, 11-->10, 12-->11, and 18-->17 transitions of
                   NaCl at 1, 2, and 3 mm have been observed, as well as
                   the J=8-->7 line of the 37Cl isotopomer. The
                   J=12-->11 line was also measured at the ARO 12 m
                   telescope. An unsuccessful search was additionally
                   conducted for AlCl toward CRL 2688, although in the
                   process new transitions of NaCN were observed. Both
                   NaCl and NaCN were found to be present in the AGB
                   remnant wind, as suggested by their U-shaped line
                   profiles, indicative of emission arising from an
                   optically thin, extended shell-like source of radius
                   ~10"-12". These data contrast with past results in
                   IRC +10216, where the distribution of both molecules
                   is confined to within a few arcseconds of the star. A
                   high degree of excitation is required for the
                   transitions observed for NaCl and NaCN; therefore,
                   these two species likely arise in the region where
                   the high-velocity outflow has collided with the
                   remnant wind. Here the effects of shocks and clumping
                   due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities have raised the
                   densities and temperatures significantly. The shell
                   source is thus likely to be clumpy and irregular. The
                   chemistry producing the sodium compounds is
                   consequently more complex than simple LTE formation.
                   Abundances of NaCl and NaCN, relative to H2, are
                   f~1.6×10-10 and ~5.2×10-9, respectively, while the
                   upper limit to AlCl is f<2×10-9. These values differ
                   substantially from those in IRC +10216, where AlCl
                   has an abundance near 10-7. The NaCl observations
                   additionally indicate a chlorine isotope ratio of
                   35Cl/37Cl=2.1+/-0.8 in CRL 2688, suggestive of
                   s-process enhancement of chlorine 37.},

                   observations of OH 231.8+4.2, a well studied bipolar
                   nebula around an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star.
                   The high angular resolution (~0.2-0.3 arcsec) and
                   sensitivity of our ALMA maps provide the most
                   detailed and accurate description of the overall
                   nebular structure and kinematics of this object to
                   date. We have identified a number of outflow
                   components previously unknown. Species studied in
                   this work include 12CO, 13CO, CS, SO, SO2, OCS, SiO,
                   SiS, H3O+, Na37Cl, and CH3OH. The molecules Na37Cl
                   and CH3OH are first detections in OH 231.8+4.2, with
                   CH3OH being also a first detection in an AGB star.
                   Our ALMA maps bring to light the totally unexpected
                   position of the mass-losing AGB star (QX Pup)
                   relative to the large-scale outflow. QX Pup is
                   enshrouded within a compact (<60 AU) parcel of dust
                   and gas (clump S) in expansion (V~5-7 km/s) that is
                   displaced by 0.6arcsec to the south of the dense
                   equatorial region (or waist) where the bipolar lobes
                   join. Our SiO maps disclose a compact bipolar outflow
                   that emerges from QX Pup's vicinity. This outflow is
                   oriented similarly to the large-scale nebula but the
                   expansion velocities are about ten times lower (~35
                   km/s). We deduce short kinematical ages for the SiO
                   outflow, ranging from ~50-80 yr, in regions within
                   ~150 AU, to ~400-500 yr at the lobe tips (~3500 AU).
                   Adjacent to the SiO outflow, we identify a
                   small-scale hourglass-shaped structure
                   (mini-hourglass) that is probably made of compressed
                   ambient material formed as the SiO outflow penetrates
                   the dense, central regions of the nebula. The lobes
                   and the equatorial waist of the mini-hourglass are
                   both radially expanding with a constant velocity
                   gradient. The mini-waist is characterized by
                   extremely low velocities, down to ~1 km/s at ~150 AU,
                   which tentatively suggest the presence of a stable
                   structure. (abridged)},

                   around asymptotic giant branch stars are sites where
                   a variety of processes such as thermochemical
                   equilibrium, shocks induced by the stellar pulsation,
                   and condensation of dust grains determine the
                   chemical composition of the material that is expelled
                   into the outer envelope layers and, ultimately, into
                   interstellar space. Aims: We aim at studying the
                   abundances, throughout the whole circumstellar
                   envelope of the carbon star IRC +10216, of several
                   molecules formed in the inner layers in order to
                   constrain the different processes at work in such
                   regions. Methods: Observations towards IRC +10216 of
                   CS, SiO, SiS, NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN have
                   been carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope in the
                   80-357.5 GHz frequency range. A large number of
                   rotational transitions covering a wide range of
                   energy levels, including highly excited vibrational
                   states, are detected in emission and serve to trace
                   different regions of the envelope. Radiative transfer
                   calculations based on the LVG formalism have been
                   performed to derive molecular abundances from the
                   innermost out to the outer layers. The excitation
                   calculations include infrared pumping to excited
                   vibrational states and inelastic collisions, for
                   which up-to-date rate coefficients for rotational
                   and, in some cases, ro-vibrational transitions are
                   used. Results: We find that in the inner layers CS,
                   SiO, and SiS have abundances relative to H2 of 4 ×
                   10-6, 1.8 × 10-7, and 3 × 10-6, respectively, and
                   that CS and SiS have significant lower abundances in
                   the outer envelope, which implies that they actively
                   contribute to the formation of dust. Moreover, in the
                   inner layers, the amount of sulfur and silicon in gas
                   phase molecules is only 27% for S and 5.6% for Si,
                   implying that these elements have already condensed
                   onto grains, most likely in the form of MgS and SiC.
                   Metal-bearing molecules lock up a relatively small
                   fraction of metals, although our results indicate
                   that NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN, despite their
                   refractory character, are not significantly depleted
                   in the cold outer layers. In these regions a few
                   percent of the metals Na, K, and Al survive in the
                   gas phase, either in atomic or molecular form, and
                   are therefore available to participate in the gas
                   phase chemistry in the outer envelope. Based on

                   for passive disks surrounding T Tauri stars. Each
                   disk is encased by an optically thin layer of
                   superheated dust grains. This layer reemits directly
                   to space about half the stellar energy it absorbs.
                   The other half is emitted inward and regulates the
                   interior temperature of the disk. The heated disk
                   flares. As a consequence, it absorbs more stellar
                   radiation, especially at large radii, than a flat
                   disk would. The portion of the spectral energy
                   distribution contributed by the disk is fairly flat
                   throughout the thermal infrared. At fixed frequency,
                   the contribution from the surface layer exceeds that
                   from the interior by about a factor 3 and is emitted
                   at more than an order of magnitude greater radius.
                   Spectral features from dust grains in the superheated
                   layer appear in emission if the disk is viewed nearly

  abstract =      {The 229 GHz (lambda1.3 mm) radio emission from
                   Orion-KL was mapped with up to 0.''14 angular
                   resolution with CARMA, allowing measurements of the
                   flux densities of Source I ("SrcI") and the
                   Becklin-Neugebauer Object (BN), the two most massive
                   stars in this region. We find integrated flux
                   densities of 310 $\pm$ 45 mJy for SrcI and 240 $\pm$
                   35 mJy for BN. SrcI is optically thick even at 229
                   GHz. No trace of the H30alpha recombination line is
                   seen in its spectrum, although the v 2 = 1,
                   5(5,0)-6(4,3) transition of H2O, 3450 K above the
                   ground state, is prominent. SrcI is elongated at
                   position angle 140$\,^{\circ}$, as in 43 GHz images.
                   These results are most easily reconciled with models
                   in which the radio emission from SrcI arises via the
                   H- free-free opacity in a T < 4500 K disk, as
                   considered by Reid et al. By contrast, the radio
                   spectrum of BN is consistent with p +/e - free-free
                   emission from a dense (ne ~ 5 × 107 cm-3), but
                   otherwise conventional, hypercompact H II region. The
                   source is becoming optically thin at 229 GHz, and the
                   H30alpha recombination line, at V LSR = 23.2 $\pm$
                   0.5 km s-1, is prominent in its spectrum. A Lyman
                   continuum flux of 5 × 1045 photons s-1, consistent
                   with that expected from a B star, is required to
                   maintain the ionization. Supplementary 90 GHz
                   observations were made to measure the H41alpha and
                   H42alpha recombination lines toward BN. Published 43
                   and 86 GHz data suggest that SrcI brightened with
                   respect to BN over the 15 year period from 1994 to
                   2009.},

  abstract =      {Context: .Within shocked regions of the interstellar
                   medium and circumstellar environment of AGB stars the
                   proper modelling of SiO line emission through non-LTE
                   radiative transfer calculations requires accurate
                   values of collisional rate coefficients. Aims: .The
                   present study focuses on the transitions among the
                   rotational levels of the SiO molecule in its ground
                   vibrational state induced by collision with He. The
                   H2 molecule being the main colliding partner for the
                   astrophysical regions of interest, the collisional
                   process between SiO and para-H2(j=0) is also
                   investigated in an approximated way. Methods: .A new
                   2D SiO-He potential energy surface is computed by
                   means of highly correlated ab initio calculations.
                   Collisional rate coefficients corresponding to the
                   pure rotational (de)excitation of SiO by collision
                   with He are obtained from close-coupling quantum
                   scattering calculations of inelastic cross sections.
                   The SiO-He potential energy surface is also employed
                   to compute rate coefficients for the rotational
                   (de)excitation of SiO by collision with para-H2(j=0).
                   Results: .Rate coefficients for rotational levels up
                   to j=26 and kinetic temperatures in the range 10-300
                   K are obtained for the SiO-He colliding system. The
                   large asymmetry of the SiO-He potential energy
                   surface induces a propensity rule that favours odd
                   Delta j transitions over even Delta j. The estimated
                   values of the SiO-para-H2(j=0) rate coefficients are
                   compared with those of Turner et al. (1992) for the
                   twenty first rotational levels. As a result of
                   significant differences between the SiO-He
                   interaction potentials employed in the two studies,
                   the rate coefficients are found to differ by a factor
                   2.5-5 for the main rotational transitions, whatever
                   the temperature range.},

                   stars like our Sun are currently being born. In this

                   including the newly discovered IR dark clouds that
                   are likely precursors to stellar clusters. At large

                   distributions with motions dominated by supersonic
                   turbulence. At small, subparsec scales, a population
                   of subsonic starless cores provides a unique glimpse
                   of the conditions prior to stellar birth. Recent
                   studies of starless cores reveal a combination of
                   simple physical properties together with a complex
                   chemical structure dominated by the freeze-out of
                   molecules onto cold dust grains. Elucidating this
                   combined structure is both an observational and
                   theoretical challenge whose solution will bring us
                   closer to understanding how molecular gas condenses
                   to form stars.},
