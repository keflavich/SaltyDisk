                   halides in IRC +10216. The millimetre-wave line
                   profiles suggest that these species are concentrated
                   in the inner circumstellar envelope. The abundances
                   derived for NaCl, AlCl, KCl, and tentatively for AlF,
                   are in the range 1012 - 1014cm-2 and are 106 -
                   108times lower than the abundance of H2. They agree
                   with the chemical equilibrium abundances calculated
                   by Tsuji (1973) for a carbon-rich stellar atmosphere
                   with a temperature 1200 - 1500K. The lines of NaCl
                   and AlCl, observed with the IRAM 30m telescope, are
                   strong enough to allow the detection of these
                   species' rare 37Cl isotopes. The derived 35Cl/37Cl
                   isotopic ratio (2.3$\pm$0.5) is consistent with the
                   terrestrial elemental isotopic ratio.},

                   and IK Tauri (IK Tau)-the first identifications of a
                   metal refractory in oxygen-rich shells of evolved
                   stars. Five rotational transitions of NaCl at 1 and 2
                   mm were detected toward VY CMa and three 1 mm lines
                   were observed toward IK Tau, using the telescopes of
                   the Arizona Radio Observatory. In both objects, the
                   line widths of the NaCl profiles were extremely
                   narrow relative to those of other molecules,
                   indicating that sodium chloride has not reached the
                   terminal outflow velocity in either star, likely a
                   result of early condensation onto grains. Modeling
                   the observed spectra suggests abundances, relative to
                   H2, of f~5×10-9 in VY CMa and f~4×10-9 in IK Tau,
                   with source sizes of 0.5" and 0.3", respectively. The
                   extent of these sources is consistent with the size
                   of the dust acceleration zones in both stars. NaCl
                   therefore appears to be at least as abundant in
                   O-rich shells as compared to C-rich envelopes, where
                   f~(0.2-2)×10-9, although it appears to condense out
                   earlier in the O-rich case. Chemical equilibrium
                   calculations indicate that NaCl is the major carrier
                   of sodium at T~1100 K for oxygen-rich stars, with
                   predicted fractional abundances in good agreement
                   with the observations. These measurements suggest
                   that crystalline salt may be an important condensate
                   for sodium in both C- and O-rich circumstellar
                   shells.},

                   identified in a source other than IRC +10216. The
                   J=7-->6, 11-->10, 12-->11, and 18-->17 transitions of
                   NaCl at 1, 2, and 3 mm have been observed, as well as
                   the J=8-->7 line of the 37Cl isotopomer. The
                   J=12-->11 line was also measured at the ARO 12 m
                   telescope. An unsuccessful search was additionally
                   conducted for AlCl toward CRL 2688, although in the
                   process new transitions of NaCN were observed. Both
                   NaCl and NaCN were found to be present in the AGB
                   remnant wind, as suggested by their U-shaped line
                   profiles, indicative of emission arising from an
                   optically thin, extended shell-like source of radius
                   ~10"-12". These data contrast with past results in
                   IRC +10216, where the distribution of both molecules
                   is confined to within a few arcseconds of the star. A
                   high degree of excitation is required for the
                   transitions observed for NaCl and NaCN; therefore,
                   these two species likely arise in the region where
                   the high-velocity outflow has collided with the
                   remnant wind. Here the effects of shocks and clumping
                   due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities have raised the
                   densities and temperatures significantly. The shell
                   source is thus likely to be clumpy and irregular. The
                   chemistry producing the sodium compounds is
                   consequently more complex than simple LTE formation.
                   Abundances of NaCl and NaCN, relative to H2, are
                   f~1.6×10-10 and ~5.2×10-9, respectively, while the
                   upper limit to AlCl is f<2×10-9. These values differ
                   substantially from those in IRC +10216, where AlCl
                   has an abundance near 10-7. The NaCl observations
                   additionally indicate a chlorine isotope ratio of
                   35Cl/37Cl=2.1+/-0.8 in CRL 2688, suggestive of
                   s-process enhancement of chlorine 37.},

  abstract =      {We present continuum and molecular line emission ALMA
                   observations of OH 231.8+4.2, a well studied bipolar
                   nebula around an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star.
                   The high angular resolution (~0.2-0.3 arcsec) and
                   sensitivity of our ALMA maps provide the most
                   detailed and accurate description of the overall
                   nebular structure and kinematics of this object to
                   date. We have identified a number of outflow
                   components previously unknown. Species studied in
                   this work include 12CO, 13CO, CS, SO, SO2, OCS, SiO,
                   SiS, H3O+, Na37Cl, and CH3OH. The molecules Na37Cl
                   and CH3OH are first detections in OH 231.8+4.2, with
                   CH3OH being also a first detection in an AGB star.
                   Our ALMA maps bring to light the totally unexpected
                   position of the mass-losing AGB star (QX Pup)
                   relative to the large-scale outflow. QX Pup is
                   enshrouded within a compact (<60 AU) parcel of dust
                   and gas (clump S) in expansion (V~5-7 km/s) that is
                   displaced by 0.6arcsec to the south of the dense
                   equatorial region (or waist) where the bipolar lobes
                   join. Our SiO maps disclose a compact bipolar outflow
                   that emerges from QX Pup's vicinity. This outflow is
                   oriented similarly to the large-scale nebula but the
                   expansion velocities are about ten times lower (~35
                   km/s). We deduce short kinematical ages for the SiO
                   outflow, ranging from ~50-80 yr, in regions within
                   ~150 AU, to ~400-500 yr at the lobe tips (~3500 AU).
                   Adjacent to the SiO outflow, we identify a
                   small-scale hourglass-shaped structure
                   (mini-hourglass) that is probably made of compressed
                   ambient material formed as the SiO outflow penetrates
                   the dense, central regions of the nebula. The lobes
                   and the equatorial waist of the mini-hourglass are
                   both radially expanding with a constant velocity
                   gradient. The mini-waist is characterized by
                   extremely low velocities, down to ~1 km/s at ~150 AU,
                   which tentatively suggest the presence of a stable
                   structure. (abridged)},

                   Array (ALMA) observations of a circumstellar disk
                   around Source I in Orion KL, an archetype of massive
                   protostar candidates. We detected two ortho-H2O lines
                   at 321 GHz (102, 9-93, 6) and 336 GHz (nu2 = 1, 52,
                   3-61, 6) for the first time in Source I. The latter
                   one is in a vibrationally excited state at the lower
                   state energy of 2939 K, suggesting evidence of hot
                   molecular gas close to Source I. The integrated
                   intensity map of the 321 GHz line is elongated along
                   the bipolar outflow while the 336 GHz line map is
                   unresolved with a beam size of 0.''4. Both of these
                   maps show velocity gradients perpendicular to the
                   bipolar outflow. The velocity centroid map of the 321
                   GHz line implies a spatial and velocity structure
                   similar to that of vibrationally excited SiO masers
                   tracing the root of the outflow emanating from the
                   disk surface. In contrast, the 336 GHz line is most
                   likely emitting from the disk midplane with a
                   diameter of 0.''2 (84 AU) as traced by radio
                   continuum emission and a dark lane devoid of the
                   vibrationally excited SiO maser emission. The
                   observed velocity gradient and the spectral profile
                   of the 336 GHz H2O line can be reconciled with a
                   model of an edge-on ring-like structure with an
                   enclosed mass of >7 M &sun; and an excitation
                   temperature of >3000 K. The present results provide
                   further evidence of a hot and neutral circumstellar
                   disk rotating around Source I with a diameter of ~100
                   AU scale.},

                   of SrcI with 0."2 angular resolution were made at 350
                   and 660 GHz to search for the H26alpha and H21alpha
                   hydrogen recombination lines and to measure the
                   continuum flux densities. The recombination lines
                   were not detected, ruling out the possibility that
                   SrcI is a hypercompact H II region. The deconvolved
                   size of the continuum source is approximately 0."23
                   × 0."07 (˜100 × 30 au); it is interpreted as a
                   disk viewed almost edge-on. Optically thick thermal
                   emission from ˜500 K dust is the most plausible
                   source of the continuum, even at frequencies as low
                   as 43 GHz; the disk mass is most likely in the range
                   0.02-0.2 {M}&sun; . A rich spectrum of molecular
                   lines is detected, mostly from sulfur- and
                   silicon-rich molecules like SO, SO2, and SiS, but
                   also including vibrationally excited CO and several
                   unidentified transitions. Lines with upper energy
                   levels {E}{{U}}\gt 500 K appear in emission and are

                   as blueshifted absorption features against the
                   continuum, indicating that they originate in
                   outflowing gas. The emission lines exhibit a velocity
                   gradient along the major axis of the disk that is

                   continuum and spectral line emission from SrcI's
                   disk. We also detect a central weakly resolved source
                   that we interpret as a hot spot in the inner disk,
                   which may indicate the presence of a binary system.
                   The high angular resolution and sensitivity of these

                   detected several other lines that more closely trace
                   the disk, but were unable to identify their parent

                   dynamical decay of a multiple-star system ~500 years

                   observations carried out with the Submillimeter Array
                   (SMA) at 880 $\mu$m centered at the B0-type protostar
                   GGD27~MM1, the driving source of the parsec scale HH
                   80-81 jet. We constrain its polarized continuum
                   emission to be $\lesssim0.8\%$ at this wavelength.
                   Its submm spectrum is dominated by sulfur-bearing
                   species tracing a rotating disk--like structure (SO
                   and SO$_2$ isotopologues mainly), but also shows
                   HCN-bearing and CH$_3$OH lines, which trace the disk

                   could indicate the presence of shocked gas at the
                   disk's centrifugal barrier or that MM1 is a hot core

                   radii and the disk's rotation velocity (3.4 km
                   s$^{-1}$ at a putative radius of 1700 AU). We roughly
                   estimate a protostellar dynamical mass of 4-18\msun.
                   MM2 and WMC cores show, comparatively, an almost
                   empty spectra suggesting that they are associated
                   with extended emission detected in previous
                   low-angular resolution observations, and therefore
                   indicating youth (MM2) or the presence of a less

  abstract =      {Context. The inner layers of circumstellar envelopes
                   around asymptotic giant branch stars are sites where
                   a variety of processes such as thermochemical
                   equilibrium, shocks induced by the stellar pulsation,
                   and condensation of dust grains determine the
                   chemical composition of the material that is expelled
                   into the outer envelope layers and, ultimately, into
                   interstellar space. Aims: We aim at studying the
                   abundances, throughout the whole circumstellar
                   envelope of the carbon star IRC +10216, of several
                   molecules formed in the inner layers in order to
                   constrain the different processes at work in such
                   regions. Methods: Observations towards IRC +10216 of
                   CS, SiO, SiS, NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN have
                   been carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope in the
                   80-357.5 GHz frequency range. A large number of
                   rotational transitions covering a wide range of
                   energy levels, including highly excited vibrational
                   states, are detected in emission and serve to trace
                   different regions of the envelope. Radiative transfer
                   calculations based on the LVG formalism have been
                   performed to derive molecular abundances from the
                   innermost out to the outer layers. The excitation
                   calculations include infrared pumping to excited
                   vibrational states and inelastic collisions, for
                   which up-to-date rate coefficients for rotational
                   and, in some cases, ro-vibrational transitions are
                   used. Results: We find that in the inner layers CS,
                   SiO, and SiS have abundances relative to H2 of 4 ×
                   10-6, 1.8 × 10-7, and 3 × 10-6, respectively, and
                   that CS and SiS have significant lower abundances in
                   the outer envelope, which implies that they actively
                   contribute to the formation of dust. Moreover, in the
                   inner layers, the amount of sulfur and silicon in gas
                   phase molecules is only 27% for S and 5.6% for Si,
                   implying that these elements have already condensed
                   onto grains, most likely in the form of MgS and SiC.
                   Metal-bearing molecules lock up a relatively small
                   fraction of metals, although our results indicate
                   that NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN, despite their
                   refractory character, are not significantly depleted
                   in the cold outer layers. In these regions a few
                   percent of the metals Na, K, and Al survive in the
                   gas phase, either in atomic or molecular form, and
                   are therefore available to participate in the gas
                   phase chemistry in the outer envelope. Based on

                   flares. As a consequence, it absorbs more stellar
                   radiation, especially at large radii, than a flat

                   H- free-free opacity in a T < 4500 K disk, as
                   considered by Reid et al. By contrast, the radio
                   spectrum of BN is consistent with p +/e - free-free
                   emission from a dense (ne ~ 5 × 107 cm-3), but
                   otherwise conventional, hypercompact H II region. The
                   source is becoming optically thin at 229 GHz, and the
                   H30alpha recombination line, at V LSR = 23.2 $\pm$
                   0.5 km s-1, is prominent in its spectrum. A Lyman
                   continuum flux of 5 × 1045 photons s-1, consistent
                   with that expected from a B star, is required to
                   maintain the ionization. Supplementary 90 GHz
                   observations were made to measure the H41alpha and
                   H42alpha recombination lines toward BN. Published 43
                   and 86 GHz data suggest that SrcI brightened with
                   respect to BN over the 15 year period from 1994 to
                   2009.},

                   medium and circumstellar environment of AGB stars the
                   proper modelling of SiO line emission through non-LTE
                   radiative transfer calculations requires accurate
                   values of collisional rate coefficients. Aims: .The
                   present study focuses on the transitions among the
                   rotational levels of the SiO molecule in its ground
                   vibrational state induced by collision with He. The
                   H2 molecule being the main colliding partner for the
                   astrophysical regions of interest, the collisional
                   process between SiO and para-H2(j=0) is also
                   investigated in an approximated way. Methods: .A new
                   2D SiO-He potential energy surface is computed by
                   means of highly correlated ab initio calculations.
                   Collisional rate coefficients corresponding to the
                   pure rotational (de)excitation of SiO by collision
                   with He are obtained from close-coupling quantum
                   scattering calculations of inelastic cross sections.
                   The SiO-He potential energy surface is also employed
                   to compute rate coefficients for the rotational
                   (de)excitation of SiO by collision with para-H2(j=0).
                   Results: .Rate coefficients for rotational levels up
                   to j=26 and kinetic temperatures in the range 10-300
                   K are obtained for the SiO-He colliding system. The
                   large asymmetry of the SiO-He potential energy
                   surface induces a propensity rule that favours odd
                   Delta j transitions over even Delta j. The estimated
                   values of the SiO-para-H2(j=0) rate coefficients are
                   compared with those of Turner et al. (1992) for the
                   twenty first rotational levels. As a result of
                   significant differences between the SiO-He
                   interaction potentials employed in the two studies,
                   the rate coefficients are found to differ by a factor
                   2.5-5 for the main rotational transitions, whatever
                   the temperature range.},

  volume =        {522},
  year =          {2010},
  abstract =      {Context. Source I in the Orion-KL nebula is believed
                   to be the nearest example of a massive star still in
                   the main accretion phase. It is thus one of the best
                   cases for studying the properties of massive
                   protostars to constrain high-mass star formation
                   theories. Near-infrared radiation from source I
                   escapes through the cavity opened by the OMC1 outflow
                   and is scattered by dust towards our line of sight.
                   Aims: The reflected spectrum offers a unique
                   possibility of observing the emission from the
                   innermost regions of the system and probing the
                   nature of source I and its immediate surroundings.
                   Methods: We obtained moderately high
                   spectral-resolution (lambda/Deltalambda 9000)
                   observations of the near infrared diffuse emission in
                   several locations around source I/Orion-KL. We
                   observed a widespread rich absorption line spectrum
                   that we compare with cool stellar photospheres and
                   protostellar accretion disk models. Results: The
                   spectrum is broadly similar to strongly veiled, cool,
                   low-gravity stellar photospheres in the range Teff
                   3500-4500 K, luminosity class I-III. An exact match
                   explaining all features has not been found, and a
                   plausible explanation is that a range of different
                   temperatures contribute to the observed absorption
                   spectrum. The 1D velocity dispersions implied by the
                   absorption spectra, sigma 30 km s-1, can be explained
                   by the emission from a disk around a massive, m_* 10
                   M_&sun;, protostar that is accreting at a high rate,
                   dot{m_*} 3 × 10-3 M_&sun; yr-1. Conclusions: Our
                   observations suggest that the near-infrared
                   reflection spectrum observed in the Orion-KL region
                   is produced close to source I and scattered to our
                   line of sight in the OMC1 outflow cavity. The
                   spectrum allows us to exclude source I being a very
                   large, massive protostar rotating at breakup speed.
                   We suggest that the absorption spectrum is produced
                   in a disk surrounding a 10 M_&sun; protostar,
                   accreting from its disk at a high rate of a few ×
                   10-3 M_&sun;/yr). Based on observations collected at
