                   halides in IRC +10216. The millimetre-wave line
                   profiles suggest that these species are concentrated
                   in the inner circumstellar envelope. The abundances
                   derived for NaCl, AlCl, KCl, and tentatively for AlF,
                   are in the range 1012 - 1014cm-2 and are 106 -
                   108times lower than the abundance of H2. They agree
                   with the chemical equilibrium abundances calculated
                   by Tsuji (1973) for a carbon-rich stellar atmosphere
                   with a temperature 1200 - 1500K. The lines of NaCl
                   and AlCl, observed with the IRAM 30m telescope, are
                   strong enough to allow the detection of these
                   species' rare 37Cl isotopes. The derived 35Cl/37Cl
                   isotopic ratio (2.3$\pm$0.5) is consistent with the
                   terrestrial elemental isotopic ratio.},

                   continuum and spectral line emission from SrcI's
                   disk. We also detect a central weakly resolved source
                   that we interpret as a hot spot in the inner disk,

                   The high angular resolution and sensitivity of these

                   identified in a source other than IRC +10216. The
                   J=7-->6, 11-->10, 12-->11, and 18-->17 transitions of
                   NaCl at 1, 2, and 3 mm have been observed, as well as
                   the J=8-->7 line of the 37Cl isotopomer. The
                   J=12-->11 line was also measured at the ARO 12 m
                   telescope. An unsuccessful search was additionally
                   conducted for AlCl toward CRL 2688, although in the
                   process new transitions of NaCN were observed. Both
                   NaCl and NaCN were found to be present in the AGB
                   remnant wind, as suggested by their U-shaped line
                   profiles, indicative of emission arising from an
                   optically thin, extended shell-like source of radius
                   ~10"-12". These data contrast with past results in
                   IRC +10216, where the distribution of both molecules
                   is confined to within a few arcseconds of the star. A
                   high degree of excitation is required for the
                   transitions observed for NaCl and NaCN; therefore,
                   these two species likely arise in the region where
                   the high-velocity outflow has collided with the
                   remnant wind. Here the effects of shocks and clumping
                   due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities have raised the
                   densities and temperatures significantly. The shell
                   source is thus likely to be clumpy and irregular. The
                   chemistry producing the sodium compounds is
                   consequently more complex than simple LTE formation.
                   Abundances of NaCl and NaCN, relative to H2, are
                   f~1.6Ã—10-10 and ~5.2Ã—10-9, respectively, while the
                   upper limit to AlCl is f<2Ã—10-9. These values differ
                   substantially from those in IRC +10216, where AlCl
                   has an abundance near 10-7. The NaCl observations
                   additionally indicate a chlorine isotope ratio of
                   35Cl/37Cl=2.1+/-0.8 in CRL 2688, suggestive of
                   s-process enhancement of chlorine 37.},

                   metal refractory in oxygen-rich shells of evolved
                   stars. Five rotational transitions of NaCl at 1 and 2
                   mm were detected toward VY CMa and three 1 mm lines
                   were observed toward IK Tau, using the telescopes of
                   the Arizona Radio Observatory. In both objects, the
                   line widths of the NaCl profiles were extremely
                   narrow relative to those of other molecules,
                   indicating that sodium chloride has not reached the
                   terminal outflow velocity in either star, likely a
                   result of early condensation onto grains. Modeling
                   the observed spectra suggests abundances, relative to
                   H2, of f~5Ã—10-9 in VY CMa and f~4Ã—10-9 in IK Tau,
                   with source sizes of 0.5" and 0.3", respectively. The
                   extent of these sources is consistent with the size
                   of the dust acceleration zones in both stars. NaCl
                   therefore appears to be at least as abundant in
                   O-rich shells as compared to C-rich envelopes, where

                   calculations indicate that NaCl is the major carrier
                   of sodium at T~1100 K for oxygen-rich stars, with
                   predicted fractional abundances in good agreement
                   with the observations. These measurements suggest
                   that crystalline salt may be an important condensate

  abstract =      {Context. The inner layers of circumstellar envelopes
                   around asymptotic giant branch stars are sites where
                   a variety of processes such as thermochemical
                   equilibrium, shocks induced by the stellar pulsation,
                   and condensation of dust grains determine the
                   chemical composition of the material that is expelled
                   into the outer envelope layers and, ultimately, into
                   interstellar space. Aims: We aim at studying the
                   abundances, throughout the whole circumstellar
                   envelope of the carbon star IRC +10216, of several
                   molecules formed in the inner layers in order to
                   constrain the different processes at work in such
                   regions. Methods: Observations towards IRC +10216 of
                   CS, SiO, SiS, NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN have
                   been carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope in the
                   80-357.5 GHz frequency range. A large number of
                   rotational transitions covering a wide range of
                   energy levels, including highly excited vibrational
                   states, are detected in emission and serve to trace
                   different regions of the envelope. Radiative transfer
                   calculations based on the LVG formalism have been
                   performed to derive molecular abundances from the
                   innermost out to the outer layers. The excitation
                   calculations include infrared pumping to excited
                   vibrational states and inelastic collisions, for
                   which up-to-date rate coefficients for rotational
                   and, in some cases, ro-vibrational transitions are
                   used. Results: We find that in the inner layers CS,
                   SiO, and SiS have abundances relative to H2 of 4 Ã—
                   10-6, 1.8 Ã— 10-7, and 3 Ã— 10-6, respectively, and
                   that CS and SiS have significant lower abundances in
                   the outer envelope, which implies that they actively
                   contribute to the formation of dust. Moreover, in the
                   inner layers, the amount of sulfur and silicon in gas
                   phase molecules is only 27% for S and 5.6% for Si,
                   implying that these elements have already condensed
                   onto grains, most likely in the form of MgS and SiC.
                   Metal-bearing molecules lock up a relatively small
                   fraction of metals, although our results indicate
                   that NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN, despite their
                   refractory character, are not significantly depleted
                   in the cold outer layers. In these regions a few
                   percent of the metals Na, K, and Al survive in the
                   gas phase, either in atomic or molecular form, and

  abstract =      {Context. Source I in the Orion-KL nebula is believed
                   to be the nearest example of a massive star still in
                   the main accretion phase. It is thus one of the best
                   cases for studying the properties of massive
                   protostars to constrain high-mass star formation
                   theories. Near-infrared radiation from source I
                   escapes through the cavity opened by the OMC1 outflow
                   and is scattered by dust towards our line of sight.
                   Aims: The reflected spectrum offers a unique
                   possibility of observing the emission from the
                   innermost regions of the system and probing the
                   nature of source I and its immediate surroundings.
                   Methods: We obtained moderately high
                   spectral-resolution (lambda/Deltalambda 9000)
                   observations of the near infrared diffuse emission in
                   several locations around source I/Orion-KL. We
                   observed a widespread rich absorption line spectrum
                   that we compare with cool stellar photospheres and
                   protostellar accretion disk models. Results: The
                   spectrum is broadly similar to strongly veiled, cool,
                   low-gravity stellar photospheres in the range Teff
                   3500-4500 K, luminosity class I-III. An exact match
                   explaining all features has not been found, and a
                   plausible explanation is that a range of different
                   temperatures contribute to the observed absorption
                   spectrum. The 1D velocity dispersions implied by the
                   absorption spectra, sigma 30 km s-1, can be explained
                   by the emission from a disk around a massive, m_* 10
                   M_&sun;, protostar that is accreting at a high rate,
                   dot{m_*} 3 Ã— 10-3 M_&sun; yr-1. Conclusions: Our
                   observations suggest that the near-infrared
                   reflection spectrum observed in the Orion-KL region
                   is produced close to source I and scattered to our
                   line of sight in the OMC1 outflow cavity. The
                   spectrum allows us to exclude source I being a very
                   large, massive protostar rotating at breakup speed.
                   We suggest that the absorption spectrum is produced
                   in a disk surrounding a 10 M_&sun; protostar,
                   accreting from its disk at a high rate of a few Ã—
                   10-3 M_&sun;/yr). Based on observations collected at
                   the European Southern Observatory, Chile. Program
